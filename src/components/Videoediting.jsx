                  you watch on OTT platforms or the ads that come in between, have you ever noticed how smooth
                   the transition from one screen to another is? To a non-editor viewer like you, it seems
                    quite easy. But if you observe carefully, you’ll notice the multiple angles shot, the
                     brightening of screen, added music and in-sync dialogues- goals which aren‘t easy to
                      achieve. Even the smallest videos take a long time to be processed, much more than their
                       shooting time. But are these efforts worth it? Yes, because videos tell us stories;
                        they are like tokens of reality similar to our lives or the experiences we have had.
                         Video editing is an art that takes lots of patience, practice and hard work to lead
                          to perfection. Here, we enlighten you with interesting facts about video production
                           and processing that are bound to mesmerize you. </p> <br/>

                 demonstrations, videos have been an integrate part of promotional activities since their inception.
                  It’s hard to make do with just static contents. Videos generate greater engagement rates.</p>

           <p style={{fontSize:"20px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Interesting Facts about Video Editing</p>

           <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Fact 1: If pictures are worth a thousand words, videos are worth million</p>

           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>People prefer videos over almost anything, whether it’s reading articles 
           or seeing a picture. In school, whenever there was a book report, most of us would go searching for
            a movie made based on the book. The movie spoke to us more, took less effort and it was easier to
             understand. Videos put thousands of photo frames together to create a series of motions. If one
              picture says thousand words, videos clearly speak million.</p>


         <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Fact 2: Video Editing requires equal dependence on skills, instinct and experience</p>

         <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Video editing isn’t a skill you can master just by taking a course. It doesn’t come to you overnight as well. It’s rather an art form. The courses and basics you learn merely provide you a base to start with. As an editor you’ll need to trust your instinct or gut feeling before making a decision. Editors’ needs to think about the pattern of the video, figure out pieces that fit together better, the sequence that makes a transition feel smoother. All this requires judgment call to be made by the editor which will come with months of practice and experience.</p>

<br/>


            <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Fact 3: Video editing requires extensive planning</p>

<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Whether it’s an ad you’re preparing for your e-store, a short film or an instruction manual – no body just gets an idea about a video and then starts shooting. The idea needs to be turned into a story board where the sequence of shots to be taken is finalized along with a written script that contains dialogues for the video. This is necessary both for shooting and editing. Seeing the amount of time and level of intercity required for editing a video you need to follow a divide and conquer approach for editing. Dividing the works into smaller segments and going through them part by part will ensure you tick all the boxes and get a good output.</p>


   <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Fact 4: Video editing can be time consuming</p>

<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Editing takes more time than shooting the video itself. Shots need to be perfected, compiled, dialogues and background sounds have to be added, colors need to be corrected – there are endless things to be done and the editors needs to be aware of all of them. Even an ad or a short instructional view may take hours to be perfected. An editor needs to have endless patience, a keen eye and a little bit of OCD to get the perfect edit. </p>

           <br/>

           <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Fact 5: Video Editing can’t fix everything</p>


           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>While seeing a video, you’ll observe the multiple angles, the close ups and different sound effects added. Editing perfects a video and converts it into an art but it can’t fix everything. Always shoot thinking of the editing part. You can’t shoot a blurred or shaky video and hope to fix it during editing. Take more angles than you hope to use, ensure you have more footages than necessary so that you don’t fall short during editing.
<br/><br/>
Video production and processing is an intricate and extensive work involving multiple steps. It is
 definitely much more complex than photo processing and will require the calmest and most passionate 
 version of you. It is still an evolving industry that’s improving day by day. So we have to be on the 
 lookout for new and exciting improvements that will help us bring a better output.</p>
