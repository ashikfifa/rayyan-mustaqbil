                 <p style={{textAlign:"justify",marginTop:"4%",fontFamily:"poppins"}}>Have you been struggling to increase search traffic to your site at the same time looking for improvements to reduce your bounce rate? Well, to get a better conception on the reasons and impact of bounce rate, take a read on our previous blog Minimize Your Bounce Rate to understand the basics of Bounce rate.  

 <br/><br/>

Here we will break down the specifics of this conversion architecture to discuss it in-depth. Through this discussion we will show you how a marketer can boost their conversion rates and build a successful site. 
</p>



               <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>How to Reduce Bounce Rate? </p>


           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Based on conversion architecture you need to do below things to reduce bounce rate and improve conversions for your blog:  </p>


           <p style={{fontSize:"16px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Check if you configured Google Analytics properly  </p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Before you do anything else, verify your Google Analytics is configured properly. If you don’t have GA set up correctly, it may not capture bounced visits on your site which can skew your results and give you a false read of either too low or too high of a bounce rate. There are three things you need to check: </p>

<p style={{fontSize:"16px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Improve Your Content’s Readability</p>

<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Your target customer may get bad user experience because of lack of readability. This happens when you use large chunk of text, blogs with lousy formatting or complex format, Scribble text etc. If you are doing this than you need to change this by using the following:  </p>

<ul>
    <li>Easy-to-read format   </li>
    <li>Big and bold headline  </li>
    <li>Using subheadings and bullet points, explain those points.  </li>
    <li>Using charts, images, screenshots, quotes.  </li>
    <li>Make your conclusion actionable etc.  </li>
</ul>

<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Let’s take a look at the images below as an example to realize the lack of readability. Please look at the below picture and decide which one is better.   </p>

<br/>






<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Avoid Popups – Don’t Disrupt the UX  </p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>When your customers casually scroll down product list while visiting, the product photo that should create a “love at first sight” reaction is your main photo. It should capture the entire product in one frame, be shot professionally and portray the actually color of product as well. Amazon requires that you shoot your main photo in a while background without any prop, text or design in order to keep things simple and avoid distraction. The product has to have the main focus and posting of original product photos is mandatory; it can’t be a graphic or drawing.  
</p>

<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>
DID YOU KNOW? <br/><br/>

70% of users say that they find irrelevant popups annoying? So, popup is a bad user experience and you cannot chase this attitude of users.  
         </p> 



         <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>      Popup disrupts visitors and they decide to leave which is leading to a higher bounce rate. To build a long-term site and generated more organic visitor you need to totally avoid or limit popups. 

 <br/><br/>

On the other hand, popups help you grow your email list quickly. You may have limited use of some well-designed popups which are less annoying and unobtrusive. </p>

<br/>


<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Improve Your Brand Storytelling </p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>    
People always remember and respond to good stories. So, you need to have something that stands out from others. It could be a subheading, a word, a term or an image. Storytelling can connect those eye-catching elements with the rest of your content. A stand out storytelling will appeal to users in a dynamic and emotional way that they will begin to trust you more. So, you will not only get loyal audience but also an increase conversion rate. But remember, great storytelling is born from a passionate belief in the truth. So, be honest in your storytelling.   </p>





<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Keep Your Blog Fresh with the Right Content  </p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>    
Keeping your blog fresh, with the right content, will always yield the best Return on Investment. According to <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/" target="none">HubSpot</a> , businesses that update their blogs with fresh content regularly will generate more leads than those who don’t. However, it’s important to differentiate powerful content from the right content. </p>


<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Target Keywords with High-Value Traffic </p> 
            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
            Keywords can make or break your content marketing campaign. Simply writing content for your blog will not adequately reduce your bounce rate or improve conversions. If you want to improve search performance, start targeting high-value keywords, because that’s where the high-value traffic is. According to LinchPin SEO, a perfect high-value keyword sits at the intersection of four important metrics:              </p>


<ol>
            <li><p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>	Traffic value  </p> 
            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
            Measure the number of visits to your website due to regular or paid search traffic.             </p>
            </li>

            <li><p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>	Conversion value   </p> 
            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
            A numerical value that you assign to specific conversions in order to represent their impact to your business          </p>
            </li>

            <li><p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Personal value    </p> 
            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
            The lens through which consumers view the world, it used to assist marketers in determining consumer choice behavior        </p>
            </li>

            <li><p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Brand value.  </p> 
            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
            It is the financial worth of the brand. To determine brand value, businesses need to estimate how much the brand is worth in the market.           </p>
            </li>


</ol>


<img src="../../assets/images/Valuable keywords.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block"  width="80%" height="20%" alt="defination-of-a-valuable-keywords"/>
<br/>

<p>You have to know what those high-value keywords are. </p>


<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Attract the Right Visitors  </p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>    
If you do not get the right visitor for your site than you will have higher bounce rate. There is nothing more powerful than publishing custom content for attracting the right visitor. In this case you need to use a content strategy that takes each stage of the buying cycle and right target audience into account and also maintains a better content quality. </p>


<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Write Attractive Meta Descriptions for Search Users  </p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>    
Many companies do not optimize their meta descriptions for search users. As a result, your click-through rate will continue to drop. Meta descriptions are HTML attributes used to describe the content of a specific web page. Search engines use meta descriptions for display. A small summary from your website so that users can simply read the description to determine if a particular search result is right for them. The optimal length of the meta description is 155 characters. If you cannot make people understand your website with these 155 characters, it may also lead to a higher bounce rate. Before you can successfully write a compelling meta description, you need to understand the structure of search results and how meta tags match keywords. For example, let’s say that your main keyword is best plumber in NY. Here’s how to include it in your description naturally: </p>

<img src="../../assets/images/meta data description example.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block"  width="80%" height="20%" alt="meta-data-description-example"/>
<br/>


<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Create Multiple Landing Pages for High-Volume Keywords </p> 
            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
            The more landing pages you have, the better. You’ll create a richer experience for your users. Creating more landing pages also increases your search click-through rate. If you see your Google Analytics you will find that most users exit your site from the home page. To solve this problem, create more landing pages, based on the high-value keywords that people are searching for in your niche. Some companies who have increased their number of landing pages from 10 to 15 have seen a 55% increase in leads. </p>
            <img src="../../assets/images/Landing-pages-on-lead-generation-chart.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block"  width="80%" height="20%" alt="Landing-pages-on-lead-generation-chart"/>
<br/>

<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Speed Up Your Page Load Time </p> 
            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
            How important is site speed to users? Well, consumers expect a web page to lead in 2 seconds or less. After 3 seconds, consumers will no longer wait for your site to load – they’ll just move on to your competitor’s site. The slower your landing pages load, the higher your bounce rate will be. And, Google is also concerned about site speed – you can slip in rankings, if your site is consistently slow to load, resulting in a higher bounce rate. The bottom line is that a slow site can destroy your business and discourage potential customers from buying from you. These consumer behavior statistics give you a clearer picture:  </p>
            <img src="../../assets/images/Customer-Behavior-Chart.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block"  width="80%" height="20%" alt="Customer-Behavior-Chart"/>
<br/>
<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
So, you need to find out your site’s current speed. Next, analyze your speed and determine if it’s time to make an improvement in this area. Some common improvement areas are removing additional plugins and only keeping essentials, removing all banner ad from sidebar, switching domain register etc.   </p>


<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Set External Links to Open in New Windows  </p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>    
When you open external links in the same tab, you create back button fatigue for users. What this means is that every time a user clicks a link to an external page, they have to click the back button to come back to your site (assuming they decide to visit again – they may get distracted by the new site). This will decrease your page views. So in your web design you should set External Links to Open in New Windows. </p>


<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Make Your Site Mobile-Friendly  </p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>    
Is your site responsive? When prospects visit your site on their iPhone, iPad, tablets and other mobile devices, will it display perfectly? It’s time to take your brand to mobile because your customers have their mobile devices with them everywhere. If you’re not convinced yet, here are a few quick facts: </p>

<img src="../../assets/images/Mobile consumption and distribution.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block"  width="80%" height="20%" alt="Mobile consumption and distribution"/>
<br/>
<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}> 
So, first and foremost, test your site by using Google’s mobile-friendly test tool. If you get a result like the figure below, then it is a red signal for you.  </p>

<img src="../../assets/images/Mobile preview.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block"  width="80%" height="20%" alt="square-image-mobile-responsive-googlebot-scaled"/>
<br/>


<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Conclusion  </p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>    
In the above discussion, we have shown you several ways to reduce your bounce rate and boost your conversion rate. But, without high-quality content, even if you succeed at cutting your bounce rate in half, your risk of increasing it again is high. To avoid that, map out a content strategy and an editorial calendar. Every site owner has to work towards gradually increasing the time that users spend reading their content. In all, keep at it and stay consistent. Keep growing your site audience. As you satisfy your users, they’ll gladly tell others about you – thus improving your search traffic, inbound links, and lead generation. </p>
