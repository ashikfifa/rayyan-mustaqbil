                 <p style={{textAlign:"justify",marginTop:"4%",fontFamily:"poppins"}}>As people of modern era, it is natural to want to stay up-to-date with ongoing trends, innovations and designs. But staying in trend is not easy. It requires you continuously acquire new stuff; whether it’s things you use or wear. In this process of buying new things and matching with the steps of the world, we end up forgetting about the old stuff that have piled up in a corner of our wardrobe, simply waiting to be discarded. Ultimately, one day you wake up in this load of old stuff that takes up so much room that you don’t know where to keep the new stuff you buy. Sounds familiar?</p>

           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Your old stuff can be usable to someone who can’t afford new things. Some people even like to store and use vintage things that give them that nostalgic thrill. So why not resell the old products you own?
<br/><br/>
Reselling is never easy. And in order to do it well, the first thing you need to do is photograph your products perfectly. In this blog, we’ll guide you with some tricks and hacks that would help you capture the true essence of your old stuff and help you with the product reselling process.
</p>
<p style={{fontSize:"20px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Tips for Product Reselling Photography:</p>
               <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Accept the vintage look</p>


           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>First, you need to embrace the fact that your products are old and already used. You don’t need to showcase them as something too flashy or ensure that new product vibe if they don’t have it. Rather, try to capture that antiqueness and vintage vibe as that is what will make your product different in a sea of new clothes.</p>

           <br/>
           <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Make sure the Products up for reselling are clean</p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>As the stuff you’re about to sell has been in use for a specific time, you need to make sure they are properly dusted and cleaned before you photograph and resell your old products. If it’s old furniture; you can dust or vacuum it and then wipe up with a cloth soaked in mild soap. If it’s a part of your wardrobe, get it washed and ironed properly. Make sure there’s no stain or crease as that can make a photo look unappealing and reduce the product’s attractiveness. Cleaning instructions vary for clothes, electronics and furniture. So make sure you look them up and understand it all before you start cleaning.</p>


<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Ensure Consistency in Themes for Product Reselling</p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Themes help decide the layout of your picture. It’s important that you pick a theme that highlights your products in the right manner. While photographing old stuff, it may see lucrative to work with monochrome (black and white) themes as that helps create a more vintage look. But as you do this, you will not be able to highlight the true color of your product. So it’s better to avoid this for product reselling purposes. You can try shooting from above to give your customers a full view. Make sure you take super close up shots (also referred to as macro-shots) to highlight different features as well. Also make sure, you follow the similar theme and pattern for all your products so it’s more eye-soothing.</p>


<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Props for popping the product up</p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>You can use interesting little props that would help with the storytelling and make the photo speak up. As reselling includes products that have been used in the past, try to take inspiration from the trends that were hyped back then. For example- if it’s an old school vintage camera, you can think of adding using wood tables and camera rolls as tools. In case of wearable, you can even think of using products as props. For instance- pair up a jacket you want to sell with the pair of matching boots you don’t use anymore. This will serve a two way purpose and make sales easier.</p>

<br/>
                 <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Don’t hide the shortcomings</p>

                 <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>A research of TrueShip shows that 20% of all product returns happen because customers receive damaged products. As you use a product for some time, it is bound to get stained or damaged in some way. The best you can do is repairing the damages before you put for sell. If the damage is visible, don’t try to hide it. Make sure the damaged parts are visible in the photographs. If it’s not visible, mention the damage and the steps taken by you to minimize it in the product description. After all, honesty is the best policy!
</p>

<br/>
                 <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Post Production Processes for Product Reselling Photography</p>

                 <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>As you are done with photographing your products, half of your worries should be gone. Now it’s time to process the product photos properly. You can either do it yourself using Photoshop or consider taking professional help from image and video editing services. Outsourcing such help will save both your time and get the expert touch that gives your product a final edge.
                 <br/><br/>
Another way to go with old product is donating them to luxury item reseller’s like- Shop Repurpose and letting them take care of all your old stuff worries. By donating, you are contributing to the society and getting rid of unused stuff from your wardrobe; enabling you to make space for new ones. It is obvious that capturing photos and selling old products will take some effort. But it’s all worth it because of the happiness it offers.
