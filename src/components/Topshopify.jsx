                 <p style={{textAlign:"justify",marginTop:"4%",fontFamily:"poppins"}}>E-commerce platforms like 
                 Shopify are ultimate friends of small business owners. The platform allows you to build your own 
                 website and shine in the world of e-commerce. Shopify takes the complexity out of the web development 
                 process and provides you user friendly development tools. Your dream to have a business that matches 
                 with your passion, that gives you a sense of freedom and relief – finally becomes true as soon as you
                  open a Shopify e-commerce store. Although Shopify eases the website development process for you,
                   the ways to shine in the world of e-commerce has to be figured out by yourself. In order to do that,
                    you need to adopt strategies that would help make your store look more attractive, enhance its
                     visibility and ultimately boost your conversion rate. Here, we’ll be highlighting some such 
                     strategies that will bring your store into the limelight it deserves. </p> <br/>

                Book by Marc Beniof <br/>
                CEO of Salesforce.com</p>

                <p style={{textAlign:"justify",marginTop:"4%",fontFamily:"poppins"}}>As the quote dictates, 
                you have two primary responsibilities. One, ensuring the best products and prices and the 
                second one is to make the store visible to your consumer base. In this blog, you will learn 
                how to do both. </p>

           <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Eyes don’t lie!</p>

           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>People rely more on their own eyes than anyone or anything else.
            This is why, you need to ensure the best quality products and portray them in the most attractive 
            manner. Consumers spend hours analyzing different aspects of the product photo and try to imagine
             how it would adjust to their lifestyle.  Keeping the immeasurable importance of product photographs
              in mind, always ensure you upload high quality product photographs into your website. Also, make 
              sure your photos are properly edited – you can do it yourself if you want or outsource it from
               photo editing services at reasonable prices.</p>

<br/>

         <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Focus on Competitive Pricing on Shopify</p>

         <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>According to a survey by Shopify Unite, currently there are more 
         than 1.7 millions sellers on the Shopify platform. So as you can see, while Shopify has its own
          advantages, it’s still home to large number of sellers who have shops that looks exactly like yours.
           In order to shine, you need to stand out from the crowd. The key and most desirable factor for
            differentiation is the price you impose on your product. Being a global platform, all buyers
             clearly have multiple options for a single product. Shoppers normally compare prices of different
              e-stores and then go for the most reasonable option, keeping the quality of the product in check.
<br/><br/>
In order to increase you sales, you need to be a part of the competition and therefore go for competitive
 pricing. The best way to do this is to automate your pricing system. The Shopify app store offers multiple
  apps that will help you in this regard. You can simply search and check them out on the Shopify app store.</p>
        
     <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Make your website SEO Friendly</p>

<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>According to a research by BrightEdge, more than 51% of website traffic 
starts with organic searches. So now, you must be worrying about how you can generate these organic searches.
 Well, you just need to place the right words in the right places! Meaning there are certain keywords that 
 most users would use when searching for a particular product. By scouting out such key words, you can place 
 them in the contents of your website. Here, by content, we just don’t mean blogs. All landing pages of your
  website, like- home page, product page, Sales page, Contact Us etc. have to be made SEO friendly. Also, do
   remember to add title and Meta descriptions with relevant keywords to all these pages as well.  Try to
    write broad and detailed descriptions of your product as they’ll both help viewers understand the product 
    better and are likely to contain relevant keywords.</p>


   <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Keep in touch with the community</p>

<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Shopify has a great community with more than 800 thousand sellers from
 across the globe. The Shopify community allows you to stay connected and build friendships with other
  Shopify sellers Here you can post asking for suggestions, solutions to your problems and help each other 
  become better through mutual learning. Become an active part of the community and you won’t even realize 
  when it becomes a place of comfort for yourself.</p>

           <br/>

           <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Customer is king</p>


           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Treat your customer as king and see how they help you expand
            your horizon in the Shopify kingdom! There are many ways you can do this. You can start with 
            a loyalty program. The main intent of a loyalty program is the make customers purchase more 
            from your Shopify store.  You can reward them with points for every purchase made, customize 
            discounts for customers with loyalty cards and arrange occasional giveaways as well. Repeated 
            customers are people whose trust you have already gained. They’re likely to be more loyal to
             you and make more purchases in accordance with their need, occasion and opportunity.</p>

               <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Reviews and Referrals to your Rescue!</p>


           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Encourage your repeated customers to write reviews for your store 
           as well. Shoppers are likely to rely more on the word of mouth of other customers than the owner.
            Reviews work as user generated contents and they have the ability to market your product more than 
            any description you write yourself. Also, encourage your customers to refer your store to others
             as well. You can offer loyalty points or special offers which can only be availed when someone 
             they recommended makes purchase or signs up to your store. This results in a win-win situation 
             for both you and your customers and builds better seller-customer relationship.</p>

<br/>
                 <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Build and Maintain Social Media Appearance</p>

                 <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Social media accounts help increase the visibility of your
                  business and enhance its credibility as well. Facebook and Instagram repeatedly have 2.19
                   and 1.3 billion active users as of 2021.  They are two of the largest platforms to reach
                    out to people and attract them to your business.
                 <br/><br/>
Open a Facebook page for your business and regularly post photos of your product; the blogs you publish and 
the offers and discounts you put on your website as well. By using Facebook shop, you can enable online shopping 
in the social media site as well. The same can be done with Instagram. This is a very good technique to promote
 your Shopify store and drive organic traffic to it.  While you’re at it, don’t forget about Pinterest. Shoppers
  often use Pinterest to see the photos and videos of their desired products. Pinterest also allows you to add
   links of the product page and attractive descriptions with keywords to the photos and videos.
<br/><br/>
Making it as a top seller of Shopify will require you complete concentration, patience and effort. It will
 take time but being calm, persistent and following the right steps, you’re bound to be successful.
