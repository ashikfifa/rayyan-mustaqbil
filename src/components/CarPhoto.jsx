            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
              Once you master the art, cars can be one of the most exciting
              things to photograph. The shiny color, flashy mirrors and fancy
              parts makes them inherently attractive. You can be a car seller
              wanting to highlight important features of the vehicle or a new
              car owner looking to picturize the memorable event. When
              motivations for photographing the same product is different, then
              different aspects will come out. Either way, some tips and guide
              regarding background, lighting and angles can help make all the
              difference in your product photographs.

              1. Choose the perfect shooting time for car photography:{" "}
            </p>

            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
              Close your eyes for a moment and think about the time of the day
              that provides you with the most aesthetic affect. The few minutes
              before sunrise and few minutes after sunset mark the beginning and
              end of a day. Such brief moments are considered golden hour due to
              the warm comfortable vibe they provide. When shooting outside,
              this is the best time to photograph your car as beautiful light
              will help capture the true color of your car, provide a homely
              aesthetic effect at the same time and help avoid reflections.{" "}

              2. Location, Location, Location!{" "}
            </p>

            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
              A good product photographer always ensures that the photo speaks
              to its viewers. This is why, we recommend you choose outdoor
              shooting over indoor in case of photographing cars. While choosing
              your location, make sure you avoid any prop or place that might
              distract the eye of the viewer. A car is a flashy object. Shooting
              it in a place surrounded by tall flashy buildings, other cars or
              equipment is probably not a good idea. Rather photograph the car
              in location customers can actually see themselves in. A friendly
              neighborhood, broad highway or close to the mountains will help
              customers visualize their future adventures with the car.{" "}

              3. Manage reflections of the car carefully{" "}
            </p>

            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
              The glossy finishing and shiny mirrors make a car reflect on
              almost everything. So whatever background you choose will
              obviously reflect on its surface. This is why, ensuring a simple
              background with an adequate space all around the car is important.
              Now, you have to make sure you don’t reflect on the car as well!
              The best way to do that is use a tripod, place it with a timer and
              then vanish before it goes off.{" "}

              4. Book the Bokeh affect!{" "}
            </p>

            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
              Your car should be the core focus of your photo. But sometimes
              even in the simplest backgrounds, it’s difficult to ensure this. A
              method called bokeh, where you defocus your background helps you
              highlight the car perfectly and avoid all distractions. What you
              have to do is place the aperture at f/2.8 and increase the shutter
              speed of your camera. This will blur out the background and focus
              just on the car. These types of shots are normally taken close-up
              to highlight specific features of the car or to provide the front
              view.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", fontWeight: "700" }}>
              5. Plan out the angles to shoot{" "}
            </p>

            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
              A car is larger in size than most products we normally see and
              photograph. Capturing all features in one or two shots is almost
              impossible. You need to plan out the angles you’ll be shooting
              from. Make sure you get the entire background and the car in one
              frame so that it’s more relatable to the viewers. Although a
              little complex to click, moving car shots are considered very
              attractive. A car driving in a highway with mountains and trees in
              background will aid the imagination of viewers as well. Also
              rather than all shots in eye level, take some from top or bottom
              angle to get an artistic feel.
            </p>

            <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", fontWeight: "700" }}>
              6. Focus on details of the car{" "}
            </p>

            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
              A car is an intently astonishing invention with amazing interior
              and exterior features. By capturing only the exteriors, you are
              leaving out half of its attractiveness and that’s not fair! So
              take your camera, march inside and start taking photos. Sit on the
              back and take a photo at eye-level so your customer knows what
              they’ll see when they look ahead. Apart from taking photos of
              different parts separately, you can also show creativity by
              zooming in on the windshield to capture the entire interior in one
              frame.

              7. Ensure Story telling in your photograph
            </p>

            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
              Different people have different purposes behind buying a car.
              While some look to buy a decent model out of necessity, others are
              collectors who look for modern and vintage cars to add to their
              collection. When you’re photographing a car, don’t just capture
              the steel and headlights. Rather capture the story it tells.
              Choose an appropriate filter, use props if necessary and pick out
              a suitable background. Go that extra mile and you’ll be able to
              produce a product photo that touches the viewer’s sentiment.
