                {/* FIRST PARAGRAPH */}

                 <p style={{textAlign:"justify",marginTop:"4%",fontFamily:"poppins"}}>Your product images are your main weapon in the intense e-commerce war of the global community. High-quality images hold your website high whereas low quality images destroy it. Therefore, you give as much effort you can to produce creatively captured and edited pictures for your website. Yet, to your surprise, number of order stays mediocre and product returns occur frequently. Customers complain that the color of the product is different from the website pictures.  
                 <br/><br/>
The problem here is different devices have different color calibration. As a result, the same product can have different color in different devices. Worrisome, right? It’s time you get introduced to sRGB- a color space that will standardize the color of the photograph among all devices; making it appear the same to your customers.  </p>



<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>What is sRGB? </p>


        {/* DESCRIPTION */}


           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Before getting into the details of sRGB, we need to understand what a color space is. A color space contains certain basic colors and by mixing them, we’re able to produce a number of different color combinations. The full form of sRGB is Standard Red Green Blue. The sRGB color space contains the three basic colors mentioned in its abbreviation and when combined, creates more consistent and brighter color photos that look same on every device. It is currently the most used and default color space in the world. </p>

<br/>

<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Benefits of sRGB for E-commerce:  </p>



{/* DESCRIPTION */}


   <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Being an e-commerce seller is not easy. It’s an extremely competitive market. In order to stand out, you need attractive, high quality pictures and sRGB helps you achieve this goal. Now, let’s discuss some of the benefits it provides- </p>


            {/* SUB-HEADING */}

     <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Color Optimization of Product Photos </p>



{/* DESCRIPTION */}


   <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Sometimes, even with sufficient natural and artificial lighting, it becomes difficult for the photographer to capture that vibrant, bright color contrast of your product. sRGB works to ease the content production process of digital photography. As you set sRGB to be your built-in color space, it creates greater variation of colors by mixing and lightening each color, making the photo look more vibrant than before.  </p>



<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Ensures better graphic design  </p>



{/* DESCRIPTION */}


   <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>People, in general, are more attracted to things that have a shinier and cleaner vibe to it. Same goes for your e-store as well. By adding high quality banners and posters, you can easily create an attractive website that people feel drawn to at first glance. Guess what? sRGB can help here as well. First, finish designing the posters and banners for your website. Then, edit them in sRGB color space to make the colors look brighter and consistent across platforms.  </p>


   <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Consistency across devices and platforms </p>



{/* DESCRIPTION */}


   <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Let’s imagine two scenarios. One is where a photo you clicked and edited looks more vibrant on the web and duller when printed out. The second scenario, on the other hand, consists of you discovering how different a photo you uploaded looks on your phone from that of your PC. In both of these situations, the color doesn’t stay the same somehow, right? I’m sure a lot of us have faced this. Being a default color space on all operating systems, sRGB ensures that the visual, whether it’s a product photo, poster or banner, stays the same across all devices and platforms; therefore increasing consistency.  </p>

<br/>


<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Lower product return rate </p>



<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Through color optimization and consistency across platforms, sRGB ensures that the same and accurate color is being displayed to all your customers. This way, when customers receive the product and realize the similarity in color, their trust in you increases and the possibility of return decreases as well.  </p>


<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Time and cost efficiency </p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Many digital photographers set their camera to sRGB mode before shooting. This little trick goes a long way in creating better quality photos. Now, they do not need to be concerned about the lighting working in their favor and can easily get brighter photos. As a result, they can click less photos which saves both cost and time. But, there is still a catch.  As sRGB combines only three basic colors, it’s limited in its capability to capture all the colors possible. So, when you set sRGB mode before shooting, there’s a possibility you might not be able to capture all the colors on the frame. Don’t worry, there’s a solution to this as well. You can first click your pictures using Adobe RGB (which has a wider color range) and then edit the photos using sRGB to get better quality photos.  
<br/><br/>
Technology has surely come a long way and we have had to update ourselves along with it to survive in the business world. One such wonder of technology is sRGB. It helps you get a cleaner and sparkling outlook on website and product images. sRGB gives a much needed finishing touch to your setup. A friend like sRGB is clearly a must for every e-commerce business owner<a href="/product-photography-how-to-take-photos-for-your-e-commerce-business" target="none"> if you are thinking of shooting your own products. </a>  </p>
