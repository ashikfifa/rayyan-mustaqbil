                 <p style={{textAlign:"justify",marginTop:"4%",fontFamily:"poppins"}}>AI is the trending, phrase for all and business owners out there. It has special relevance in changing the way we capture moments in time and work our way to process them. Yes, I am talking about how AI can and is already revolutionizing the<b> image editing</b> industry.  

Technology allows us to set up systems and processes that begin and end on their own. In business, technology is used in nearly each single department, starting from HR, automated marketing, inventory management. More computer software companies are presently switching over to machine learning. However, post-production of images is an exceptional story. It is usually a repetitive job, specially clipping of images, altering the background and basic retouching of mannequin or products. This makes the editing process much faster and help users focus on the creative output instead of the monotonous manual task's commonplace in editing apps. Creativity can change the complete outcome of an image. To know more about the creativity of an image editing process, have a read through our blog The Importance of Creativity in Image Editing.

           <br/>
           <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>So, How Does AI work?  </p>


           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>AI takes in information given by humans; this technology uses deep learning to process information become more powerful overtime by learning from its mistakes and gathering more information and working more efficiently. Basically, this innovation imitates or replaces human intelligence, and it’s more effective for essential tasks and ideas.  

There are as of now many different styles of AI<b> image editing software</b> accessible. It is most essential for photographers, image editors, or creative designers who need their image to stand-out in a blink of eye.  

</p>

<br/>

               <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>So, what are the features of a basic AI image editor, you wonder?  </p>


           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>AI can mostly tell that your white levels of your images are too warm, or the image colors are not balanced, or if clarity controls of the image are needed. One tap of the screen, and these new image processing software and applications can:  </p>


           <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Remove backgrounds   </p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>E-commerce websites now a days are opting for a clean and sleek look. Almost all high-quality products are being highlighted with a white background, solid color, or transparent background. AI-powered <b>image editing software</b> can <b>remove backgrounds </b>in a breeze. It helps you cut out the most difficult corners like hair and other structured area with precision and accuracy in just a few clicks on the undesired background.  </p>



<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Alter the landscapes     </p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Changing the landscape of a bright and sunny day to a rainy one can be a very difficult process. Although, it takes time and process and more information to gather up for the perfect automated landscape weather changing. Once it has been processed into the system it can then turn images from snowy to sunny, day to night or even, fall to spring in an ease
</p>
<img src="../../assets/images/weather change before after.jpeg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block"  width="80%" height="20%" alt="weather change before after"/>
<br/>


<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Auto-adjust the lighting of an image    </p>


<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Typically, for say<b> food photography</b> needs handful of sliders to process a photo. You need to use many layers to highlight, or<b> drop shadow</b>, or make contrasts. While with AI, in any case, photographers require just one automated layer. The program chooses how to change things like saturation, contrast, and radiance. Once more, it does this naturally.  

  <br/><br/>

While AI might do a great job processing the basics, the technology is very limiting, especially from a creative point of view. This implies you might not get the result, and it ultimately might require manual tweaking. Quality control is also important when you’re going to let an AI powered <b> photo editing service</b> provider do the editing work for you. Moreover, AI doesn’t totally eradicate the need to do edits by hand. You still have to review each image before giving it off to the computers or <b>image editing companies</b>. But, in most situations it makes sense to take advantage of AI to speed up your editing workflow.  

When you have lots of editing to do and have deadlines, AI can help speed things up and can save you a good deal of time. Allocate the basics tasks, like basic resizing or <b> background removal</b>, to the computers so you can focus on the more important and creative details of the image editing process. Not everyone has the time and resources to dive into AI head-on, digging and discovering what and how AI can improve your images but, future of <b> image and video editing</b> is certainly AI. It is indisputable how AI software offers plenty of benefits with the image editing process. So, what do you think about Artificial Intelligence being used in the field of image editing?  </p>
