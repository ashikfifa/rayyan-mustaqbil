           {/* DESCRIPTION */}

           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>The technical and creative set of skills required usually cross more than one photography genre. As a beginner many of us photographers take a snap of whatever we see is exciting without being concerned about the continuity between each photo. If you want to find your photography guideline, ask yourself these following questions: </p>



        <ol>
            <li>What are your company goals with photography? </li>
            <li>Which category of clients are you targeting? </li>
            <li>What are your photography materials? </li>
            <li>What are your photography inspirations? </li>
            <li>What story do you want to convey with your photographs? </li>
        </ol>

        {/* DESCRIPTION */}
           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>These simple questions have much more depth to look into. Once you’ve answered these questions, you’ll be able to understand your style of photography and focus on a common theme. After that you have to understand the various aspects of the photograph itself.  
<br/><br/>
There’s various genre of photography that includes wedding, event, product, abstract, nature, fine art, architectural, wildlife, photojournalism, scientific, aerial, etc. </p>

  

<p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Let’s know more about depth of creating a style for your brand.   </p>



<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
If your company is for wedding photography you will most likely focus on the following elements which are; Portraits, natural lighting, candid photographs that express emotions or have wildlife in the background.  
<br/>
On the other hand, we have product photography companies that focusses on lighting terminology, artificial background, all in all making a certain product stand out.  
<br/>
Implementing a photo style guide effectively can be tricky. Choosing your photography style doesn’t just stop at choosing a genre it also includes the composition of your photos such as: 
</p>


<ul>
    <li>
    <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Subjects </p>
    <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
    A single photograph can show several things, the point where you’ve focused in the photograph and also, it’s entire figurative point of views.  
<br/><br/>
For example:  
<br/>
It is the emotions of the subjects or the position of the object that you represent, while keeping in mind what the background is representing in that situation as well.  
<br/>
The image on the left is just a lamp, while on the right we have an image that is visualising a lamp along with other furniture as well. The image on the right simply represents what your brand has to offer in one single photo. 
</p>

<br/>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}> Colour palette </p>

       <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>   One particular colour palette is usually followed by brand that the normally matches the established brand-guide or theme. Identify what your brand is about so you can align with relevant colors, example: your company emphasises on the fun or entertaining aspects, you’ll most likely be using bright colours for your palette. On the other hand, or your brand is targeted towards formal and conventional part of audience. In that case you’ll be choosing subtle or pastel colours for your palette. 
   </p>
    </li>
    

    <li>
    <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}> Positioning & framing  </p>

       <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>  This might seem like a small function but it represents elements of a scene to create a frame that is within your frame. So, know your focus and be creative. Take a look at the difference between images below. The difference might be very subtle but the image on the right with a good framing is more pleasing to the eye and catches one's attention.

<br/>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}> Consistency </p>
