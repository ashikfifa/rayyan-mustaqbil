           <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Embrace the holidays!</p>

           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Winter is the season of holidays! It’s starts with Halloween, Thanksgiving,
            and ends with Christmas and New Year. The holidays are one of the major reasons you see a spur in consumer
             demand. You have to embrace the holiday themes in your store. Redesign your website with appropriate props
              and colors. For example- you can use a red and white theme for Christmas and design it with image props
               like- the Santa hat, snowfall, reindeer etc. Also, focus on creating separate sections with festival
                collections and offers as well. Doing all this adds a festive mood to the store, making celebrations 
                more and more special for both your customers and yourself!</p>

         <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Bring back the nostalgia</p>

         <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Winter is the season of nostalgia. It’s the season that brings 
         back old memories and creates now ones at the same time. It’s the season of singing carols, 
         spending hours playing with snowballs and building Snowmen. It’s the season when the entire
          family seats around the fireplace, opens presents under the Christmas tree on the Christmas 
          morning and sings Christmas carols together. These are the emotions you have to channel to your 
          customers. In your winter collections, try to add lifestyle photos that portray such nostalgic moments 
          with your products in us. It is also a good idea to use common catchphrases like “Ho ho ho” or famous
           quotes like- “Winter is Coming” from the show Game of Thrones to bring a smile on your
            consumers face.</p>
        

            <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Focus on Customer Interaction</p>

<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>The best marketing is one that connects and communicates with customers.
 Winter is the season when people stay at home more to protect themselves against the cold weather. This 
 enables them to have more free time. Utilize this by holding surveys and quizzes where you try to learn
 what your customers are looking for and how they perceive your brand. Your clients are surely the best 
 judges of your business. These tactics will help you gain insights about consumer preferences and habits
  and get feedback as well. Keeping the holidays in mind, you can hold different contests as well. For 
  instance- announcing a photography contest (with a desired reward, obviously) where people post their
   “best winter memory”. This way, you’ll be able to bring out nostalgic memories and have your page filled 
   with heartwarming photographs as well. These tactics will help increase the visibility of your store and 
   likely increase your traffic as well.</p>


   <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Arrange for Sales and Offers</p>

<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>As the weather changes abruptly, people require a change in most of 
the items they own – be it the dresses they wear or the home decor to keep the house warm. But income 
doesn’t increase proportionately with spending needs, does it? Be the understanding, consumer-friendly 
seller you are and focus on setting reasonable prices that benefit both you and the consumer. Here, 
focusing on making a profit from bulk quantities rather than from setting high prices is a more appropriate
 strategy. Also, offer discounts and hold sales on your website and market them on all your advertising
  channels as this is the time people are likely looking for sales to fit all their demanded products within
   their budget.</p>

           <br/>

           <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Focus more on Social Media Marketing</p>


           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>As we discussed earlier, during winter, people get more time to 
           be on their phones as the cold forces them to stay at home. As a result, an increase in online
            shopping has been observed as well. This is the reason you should focus more on social media 
            marketing. Start by making a calendar and properly planning your posts. It’s important to maintain 
            consistency and relevancy in the content you post. This is why your content should be in line with
             the product and industry you operate in. Use social media to highlight the products on your website.
              Also, update viewers of the offers, deals, and discounts you’re offering on your website.
               Run polls asking them what kinds of collections they want to see next and take their opinions
                on different matters. Make sure you post high quality product images of the products you’re 
                selling right now or hope to sell in the future. High quality images will help your customers
                 know how attractive your product really is, whereas poor quality images will drag down the
                  reputation of your business.</p>

               <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Make shopping an experience, not a chore</p>


           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Winter is the time to shower your close ones with gifts and
            surprises. Make your customers feel like a part of your family by providing them with small
             gifts that catches them by surprise. The gifts don’t have to be expensive as well; rather 
             it’s the surprise element that will get you on their good books. Also, arrange giveaways by 
             inviting them to help expand this family of yours. As they refer your website to their dear 
             ones or invite them to your social Medias, it will help your help you enter new horizons.</p>

<br/>
                 <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Let’s make winter easier!</p>

                 <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>While winter showers a lot of people with feelings
                  of joy, many suffer from misery due to their poor financial conditions. By engaging
                   in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), you can use your business to make winter 
                   easier. For example, you can launch campaigns where a specific percentage of every 
                   sale goes to help people in need. Setting reasonable prices can help people greatly 
                   too, as it enables them to buy more products. Doing these things will likely generate
                    a positive image for your business and may even end up boosting your sales. But be
                     careful as you arrange such campaigns. Whatever you do should be from the heart,
                      and the intent to do something good has to be present as well.
<br/><br/>
Winter is the season of joy- for both consumers and sellers. It’s full of festivals,
 excitement and happiness. It’s the time for your e-commerce store to shine and rise 
 up conversion rate. All this is achievable by simply following the right marketing strategies 
 and giving your full focus and effort. </p>
