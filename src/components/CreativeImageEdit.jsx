           {/* DESCRIPTION */}

           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Though complex techniques and digital editing may require a software program, experience and training, you can execute simple photo-editing techniques fairly easily. Read our blog to know how.  
<br/><br/>
Let’s assume you’ve done the following editing steps to your raw image:   </p>

<ul typeof="dashes">
    <li>Shoot your product in a <b>photo studio</b> </li>
    <li>Uploaded your image to your computer </li>
    <li>The image is loaded into your software program of choice </li>
    <li>You’ve completed basic edits noise reduction, white balance, contrast, resizing and cropping etcetera.</li>
</ul>

<br/>

<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Do you think just this is enough to for a product image to be advertised? Definitely Not! 
<br/><br/>
So, after this you go on and process your images even more without having a basic idea of what your end product should look like or getting help of an <b>ecommerce photo editing service</b> provider. This is where most people make a common mistake - they keep adding chaos. Editing can either bring your vision to life or ruin your photos. But don’t feel too out of your comfort zone, because we’ve got you covered to avoid the following mistakes:  </p>


        <ol>
            <li><p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}> Noisy Backgrounds (Use <b>background removal</b>)  </p>
                
            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}> Try to keep everything in the image simple and clean so that your product stands out. Removing backgrounds is the best way to do add and remove different backgrounds as you deem fit. Keep in mind to focus directly onto the product without having any distractions.  </p>

         </li>


            <li><p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Too much change in two images (Maintain<b>product photo editing</b> consistency) </p> 
            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
            When change occurs too often in your images, the lack of consistency can confuse your customer and discredit your products. The way you present your products strengthens your brand image, and the way they appear alongside each other maintaining consistency is key to building credibility of your online store. While image processing, you should aim for a standardised approach covering the first basics - <b>image margin</b>, sharpening, saturation and finally how you save for web size and quality. Then keep the background and theme of your product constant instead of changing it to a different background for each item.  
            </p>
            </li>


            <li><p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Compulsive Cropping (Avoid various image margin for same set of products) </p> 
            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
            Showing multiple images varying in size and direction, for example horizontal or vertical and large or small, can be very confusing. Make sure your images are all of the same size and dimension. To make things easier you can create a template, according to your own guidelines, to ensure uniformity and consistency across images. 
            <br/><br/>
Even after figuring out these simple editing processes your images still need a that extra flare to really catch the attention of your customer. Here’s how!  </p>
