           <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Get product photography idea from big brands and experts</p>

           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>It’s always a good idea to do a thorough research first and then jump into action. The same applies for 
           product photography. Being new to this e-commerce business, it’s more likely that you’re not an expert 
           in product photography. This is why you need to focus on educating yourself first. List down the big
            companies in your industry and visit their website. Now try to comprehend the techniques they are
             applying in photographing their product; the number and types of photos they are posting, the angles
              being used etc. For example- you may notice websites posting a main photo consisting of only the
               product and other shots where details of the product are properly highlighted. You can see videos
                on YouTube as well and read different blogs as well to get an initial understanding of product
                 photography as well.</p>



         <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Work with a Home Studio or Natural Setup for small business product photography</p>
        

            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>For a small business, affording a full formal
             photo studio along with the expensive tools in it may seem scary. And keeping the amount
              of sales you’re likely to make or the range of collections a small business may own, 
              it doesn’t seem worth it as well. You do not need a fully designed photo studio to photograph
               your products. Rather, you can easily setup a home studio and photograph your products there.
                Pick a comfortable corner of your house with good lighting and decorate it with a table, 
                tripod, camera and a white cloth for the background. That’s it, you’re good to go!</p>

                </div>

            </div><br/>

<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Other than that, you can focus on lifestyle photography where 
you take photos with a relevant background and natural lighting.  Also, pairing up your products 
and shooting them together can aid your business by reducing the need for props and result in duel 
sales.  Try to pick a relevant setup, for example- photographing wines near a vineyard or grape garden,
 cars on the road, men and women’s formal wear near a tall corporate building etc. This is likely to help
  the viewer better imagine the product’s use in their lives.</p>


   <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Rely on easier to find tools</p>

<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Photo shoot require tools and equipment that you can’t escape from. 
Rather than focusing on getting professional and expensive tools, it’s better to initially start with
 highly available and DIY solutions. There are certain tools you can make at home. Instead of a backdrop,
  you can simply use a white wall or paper or simply the floor of your studio (for flat lay photography).
   You can easily make a DIY softbox that will deflect light perfectly and redirect it equally in all corners
    of the room. Also, if you’re looking for props to use for in the photo shoots, try to think with your
     creative eye and focus on getting tools that are easily available to you. For example- if you’ve a 
     face wash with vitamin C in it, pairing it up with sliced up oranges/lemon and plants you have at home 
     may do the trick.</p>

           <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>I’m sure you have seen big brands working with famous models in
            expensive setups and maybe you will do the same one day but it’s better to start small for now. 
            Focusing on easier to conduct photo shoot techniques will help you save both time, effort and money
             – all of which can be better utilized on all the other things you have on your plate. One such 
             technique is flat lay photography. By using flat lay, you don’t have to worry about spending money
              on mannequins or models and get clear, full views of your product at the same time.</p>

<br/>
                 <p style={{fontSize:"18px",fontWeight:"700"}}>Photo Editing is a must!</p>

                 <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>In order to be a professional seller, you have to post 
                 your product photos in a professional manner as well. This means shooting the images
                  raw and then getting them properly edited before uploading to the website. Post production 
                  will aid your e-commerce business immensely and help your images live up to their full 
                  potential. You can take a short course on image editing yourself as you’ll be needing it 
                  on a regular basis or simply outsource it form expert services and shift your focus in other
                   important areas.
<br/><br/>
While owning a small business has its struggles, it provides immense rewards as well. Having a business
 of your own gives you a sense of freedom and fulfills your heart. It’s the way you become your own boss
  and make your own decisions. In order to keep this feeling of freedom alive, you need to achieve and
   maintain success on your business. Photographing and uploading high quality product photos are one of
    the essentials things that will help you boost sales and maintain this success in your business.</p>
