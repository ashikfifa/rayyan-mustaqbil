The scenario described bulks up your products returns and your continually loose customers and slowly your reputation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"20px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Guide to Clothing Photography:</p>\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>In this section we’ll be providing you with step by step guide about how to take the perfect product photos for your apparel e-store.\r\n           </p>\r\n           \r\n\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Accept the Originality </p>\r\n\r\n           <i style={{fontSize:\"20px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>I don’t design cloths, I design dream</i>        <br/> <br/>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"right\",fontFamily:\"poppins\",fontSize:\"18px\"}}>Ralph Lauren<br/>\r\nAcclaimed Founder and Designer <br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.ralphlauren.com/\">Ralph Lauren</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\",marginTop:\"4%\",fontFamily:\"poppins\"}}>People put a lot of thought into their clothing decisions. So when you deliver something different from the pictures you provide, you end up shattering their dreams. Customers don’t look for a fancy model with perfect figure posing on a beach. They would rather have original high-resolution product photographs that are clicked by you. Such photographs enhance the credibility of the product and by extension, the seller. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n <img src=\"../../assets/images/simple-women-s-streetwear-fashion-set_53876-123181.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"simple-women-s-streetwear-fashion-set\"/> \r\n           <br/>\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Pre-plan the cloth photography setup</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Before anything else, it’s important to decide how you’ll be displaying the cloths for the photo shoot. There are two ways you can go about this. One, you can use live models or mannequins so your customers can better understand the shape and fitting of the cloth. Two, you can flat lay the cloths on a table or the ground properly and then start taking product photos. As you can already guess, flat lay is the cheapest option available but doesn’t produce the most attractive outcome. In order to provide that realistic feel, it’s better to go for live models. And if you can’t afford that, mannequins are suitable as well. Also, only looking at the background is not enough; equal emphasize has to be put on the background as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/women-taking-photo-shirts-with-smartphone-digital-camera-post-sell-online-internet-600x480.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"women-taking-photo-shirts-with-smartphone-digital-camera-post-sell-online-internet\"/> \r\n           <br/>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Simple backdrop, exquisite apparel </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Shooting outside the studio, in an exotic location may be suitable for lifestyle or fashion photo shoots. But in apparel and clothing photography, you main goal is to communicate the cloth to your customers and for that, plain white backgrounds are the best. Having too fancy a background may distract viewers from the clothes and they may miss out on certain details. You don’t even need a studio for this. Just pick a corner of your home, get a big plain white paper and tap it to the wall. Problem solved!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/winer-fashion-look-stylish-brunette-model-brown-coat-ankle-boot-black-leather-posing-600x400.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"winer-fashion-look-stylish-brunette-model-brown-coat-ankle-boot-black-leather-posing\"/> \r\n           <br/>\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Bright light, brighter product sales! </p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>When choosing a cloth, the color matters a great deal and it is one of the main variables customers base their choice on. This is why, you want a light that portraits the true color of your cloth. Balance is key here. You do not want inadequate light to make your item look dull and old or too much of it to soften the original color. First, do not rely on natural lighting only. Second, buy a small softbox so you can direct it to your product while shooting and ensure proper lighting. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Prepare Ahead for your clothing photography </p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Due to long journeys and staying in the storehouses for a long time, clothes often look a little dirty, creased and as a result old. This is why you need some preparation before shooting. Make sure you wash and properly iron the clothes first. No wrinkles should be visible on your clothes. If you’re looking to work with models or mannequins, have some clips with you to properly fit the apparel to the models body.  Once you fit the cloth to the models body, make sure price tag or labels that will distract the viewers are hidden away \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>360 degree clothing photography</p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>When photographing your apparel products, your aim is to provide your customers with 360 degree product photographs to give them a true to life feeling. Also, there are some clothes with special features like- lke pockets or linings which you might want to highlight as well There are two ways you can do this. You can take multiple photos from all possible angles so no single design goes missing. Or, you can go for 360 degree clothing photography where using 3D format, a cloth can be shown in full rotation. Although this is a little complex, learning this can make your work easier in long term. Regardless of the one you choose, make sure you take close up shoots as well where material and design can be understood easily.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/19333397-600x504.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"360 degree view of hoodies in white and black color\"/> \r\n           <br/>\r\n\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Editing for Clothing Photography\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Regardless of how much effort you put in, there’s bound to be at least on wrinkle or crease left on your cloth. Not only that, even with the right lighting, you might not be able to capture the correct color of the apparel product. You might need to zoom out or crop a photo to ensure better focus. Through tools like color correction and Photoshop, you can easily solve these product photo editing problems. Editing is a must for apparel product photography. You can take help from photo editing services as well to increase accuracy level.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe goal of clothing photography is not to create unrealistic expectations. Rather, it is to showcase both the \r\nimportant features and flaws (if any) of the cloth and help create a realistic expectation so customers can \r\nimagine how they’ll look in these apparels. Many sellers try to modify the designs or colors of their product, \r\nthinking this will lead to higher sales and better profit. This is a very short sighted approach. When customers \r\nreceive something below their expectation, they feel betrayed. As a result, the seller’s product\r\n returns and negative reviews increases.  To turn the goal of high sales and satisfied customers\r\n  into a reality, you need to follow the clothing product photography guidelines properly. The result will\r\n   truly astonish you.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n             </div>\r\n\r\n             <div className=\"col-md-4\">\r\n            \r\n                <div class=\"row\">\r\n                <div class=\"col-4 col-md-4\"> \r\n                    <div class=\"row-8\">\r\n                <img src=\"../../assets/images/types-of-photography.jpg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                {/* <div class=\"row-4\"style={{marginTop:\"37%\"}}>\r\n                <img src=\"assets/images/latestblog.jpg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n                </div> */}\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n                <div class=\"col-8 col-md-8\">\r\n                <div class=\"row-4\">\r\n                <Link to=\"/types-of-photography-which-one-drive-your-inner-passion-most\"style={{textDecoration:\"none\"}}>\r\n                    <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontFamily:\"poppins\",color:\"black\"}}>Types Of Photography: Which One Drives Your Inner Passion Most?</p>\r\n                    </Link>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                <div class=\"row-8\">\r\n                    <p style={{fontSize:\"14px\",fontWeight:\"100\",opacity:\"0.6\"}}>Photographs are our way of capturing the world as we see it.
