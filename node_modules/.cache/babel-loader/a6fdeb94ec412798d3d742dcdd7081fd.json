Choose the perfect shooting time for car photography: </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Close your eyes for a moment and think about the time of the day that provides you with the most aesthetic affect. The few minutes before sunrise and few minutes after sunset mark the beginning and end of a day. Such brief moments are considered golden hour due to the warm comfortable vibe they provide. When shooting outside, this is the best time to photograph your car as beautiful light will help capture the true color of your car, provide a homely aesthetic effect at the same time and help avoid reflections. </p>\r\n\r\n <img src=\"assets/images/car-with-sport-modern-design-parked-road-1-600x355.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"\"/> \r\n           <br/>\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>2. Location, Location, Location! </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>A good product photographer always ensures that the photo speaks to its viewers. This is why, we recommend you choose outdoor shooting over indoor in case of photographing cars. While choosing your location, make sure you avoid any prop or place that might distract the eye of the viewer. A car is a flashy object. Shooting it in a place surrounded by tall flashy buildings, other cars or equipment is probably not a good idea. Rather photograph the car in location customers can actually see themselves in. A friendly neighborhood, broad highway or close to the mountains will help customers visualize their future adventures with the car.  </p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"assets/images/pexels-brett-sayles-1592261-600x400.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"\"/> \r\n           <br/>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>3. Manage reflections of the car carefully </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>The glossy finishing and shiny mirrors make a car reflect on almost everything. So whatever background you choose will obviously reflect on its surface. This is why, ensuring a simple background with an adequate space all around the car is important. Now, you have to make sure you don’t reflect on the car as well! The best way to do that is use a tripod, place it with a timer and then vanish before it goes off. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>4. Book the Bokeh affect! </p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Your car should be the core focus of your photo. But sometimes even in the simplest backgrounds, it’s difficult to ensure this. A method called bokeh, where you defocus your background helps you highlight the car perfectly and avoid all distractions. What you have to do is place the aperture at f/2.8 and increase the shutter speed of your camera. This will blur out the background and focus just on the car. These types of shots are normally taken close-up to highlight specific features of the car or to provide the front view.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>5. Plan out the angles to shoot  </p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>A car is larger in size than most products we normally see and photograph. Capturing all features in one or two shots is almost impossible. You need to plan out the angles you’ll be shooting from. Make sure you get the entire background and the car in one frame so that it’s more relatable to the viewers. Although a little complex to click, moving car shots are considered very attractive. A car driving in a highway with mountains and trees in background will aid the imagination of viewers as well. Also rather than all shots in eye level, take some from top or bottom angle to get an artistic feel.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>6. Focus on details of the car  </p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>A car is an intently astonishing invention with amazing interior and exterior features. By capturing only the exteriors, you are leaving out half of its attractiveness and that’s not fair! So take your camera, march inside and start taking photos. Sit on the back and take a photo at eye-level so your customer knows what they’ll see when they look ahead. Apart from taking photos of different parts separately, you can also show creativity by zooming in on the windshield to capture the entire interior in one frame.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"assets/images/pexels-pixabay-326259-600x396.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"\"/> \r\n           <br/>\r\n\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>7. Ensure Story telling in your photograph \r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Different people have different purposes behind buying a car. While some look to buy a decent model out of necessity, others are collectors who look for modern and vintage cars to add to their collection. When you’re photographing a car, don’t just capture the steel and headlights. Rather capture the story it tells. Choose an appropriate filter, use props if necessary and pick out a suitable background. Go that extra mile and you’ll be able to produce a product photo that touches the viewer’s sentiment.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n                <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                    <img src=\"assets/images/grey-blue-cars-put-each-other-cloudy-sky-1024x589.jpg\"width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                    <img src=\"assets/images/white-modern-sport-car-parking-road-1024x683.jpg\"width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div><br/>\r\n\r\n        <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Cars are beautiful long term companions that help us reach our destinations and carry us through bad times and good.
