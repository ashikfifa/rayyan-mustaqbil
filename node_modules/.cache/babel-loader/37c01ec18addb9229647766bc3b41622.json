Once you’ve answered these questions, you’ll be able to understand your style of photography and focus on a common theme. After that you have to understand the various aspects of the photograph itself.  \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThere’s various genre of photography that includes wedding, event, product, abstract, nature, fine art, architectural, wildlife, photojournalism, scientific, aerial, etc. </p>\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Let’s know more about depth of creating a style for your brand.   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>\r\nIf your company is for wedding photography you will most likely focus on the following elements which are; Portraits, natural lighting, candid photographs that express emotions or have wildlife in the background.  \r\n<br/>\r\nOn the other hand, we have product photography companies that focusses on lighting terminology, artificial background, all in all making a certain product stand out.  \r\n<br/>\r\nImplementing a photo style guide effectively can be tricky. Choosing your photography style doesn’t just stop at choosing a genre it also includes the composition of your photos such as: \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Subjects </p>\r\n    <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>\r\n    A single photograph can show several things, the point where you’ve focused in the photograph and also, it’s entire figurative point of views.  \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFor example:  \r\n<br/>\r\nIt is the emotions of the subjects or the position of the object that you represent, while keeping in mind what the background is representing in that situation as well.  \r\n<br/>\r\nThe image on the left is just a lamp, while on the right we have an image that is visualising a lamp along with other furniture as well. The image on the right simply represents what your brand has to offer in one single photo. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/Lamp-focus-diffence.jpeg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"chart of cutomer service attributes\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n{/* PASPASHI DUITA IMAGE DITE CHAILE */}\r\n\r\n\r\n                <div class=\"row\">\r\n                <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n\r\n                    {/* 1ST IMAGE */}\r\n\r\n                    <img src=\"../../assets/images/top-view-meat-soup-with-greens-seasonings-dark-background.jpg\"width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n\r\n                    {/* 2ND IMAGE */}\r\n\r\n                    <img src=\"../../assets/images/rainbow-layer-cake-isolated-white-background.jpg\"width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"rainbow-layer-cake-isolated-white-background\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n        {/* HEADING */}\r\n\r\n         <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Pick a background that speaks to you</p>\r\n\r\n{/* DESCRIPTION */}\r\n\r\n         <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>The primary goal of food photography is to make the viewers \r\n         crave for it.

Keeping that\r\n in mind, the lighting for food photography needs to be soft, eye soothing and shouldn’t distract \r\n attention in any way. It’s best to go for natural lighting. Pick a spot near a large window, place your\r\n  dish on a table and conduct the shoot during the golden hour (the short vibrant time after sunrise or \r\n  before sunset). Other than that, you can go for artificial options such as– <b>Softbox</b> with a golden \r\n  lighting to be reflected all over. Make sure the lights are coming from a slight angle and not directly\r\n   behind the food. Also refrain from using harsh lighting such as- direct sunlight or in-camera flashes \r\n   that may distort the original color of your dish.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{/* SINGLE IMAGE */}\r\n\r\n\r\n        <img src=\"../../assets/images/6159822-768x432.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"Illustration of banner for winter collection with discount\"/>\r\n           <br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Use props</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Props are like friends or companions to the main dish. They provide support to the main subject by enhancing its beauty and are normally either related to the ingredients or crockeries used in cooking or presenting the dish. Do remember that props are enhancing elements, they shouldn’t stand out more than the main dish or distract viewers in any way. Although the dish itself is good enough to stand out in the first picture, the spices added in the second pictures makes it look more fulfilled and vibrant that before- thus illustrating the magic props can bring to a food photograph.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{/* PASPASHI DUITA IMAGE DITE CHAILE */}\r\n           <div class=\"row\">\r\n                <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n\r\n                    \r\n                    <img src=\"../../assets/images/top-view-vegetable-soup-with-meat-inside-plate-grey-1024x684.jpg\"width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"top-view-vegetable-soup-with-meat-inside-plate-grey\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                    <img src=\"../../assets/images/top-view-delicious-vegetable-soup-with-seasonings-grey-space-1024x684.jpg\"width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"top-view-delicious-vegetable-soup-with-seasonings-grey-space\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Fresh food for fresh photos</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>A freshly cooked meal with smoke still coming out of it looks more attractive than anything. The aroma, the vibrant color speaks to us all. As time goes by, the color becomes dull, food becomes soggy and dint or spots can start appearing as well. Never let food sit for too long before photographing it. No amount of light or editing can provide the vibrancy a freshly cooked meal can. If you’re working with vegetables or fruits, it’s best to buy them the day before the shoot. If that’s not possible and you have to buy them beforehand, cover them with a wet napkin before storing it in the fridge. That way, the water will protect the food from getting dinted.\r\n           <br/><br/>\r\nWhile photographing delicious looking food is one of the most fun things you’ll ever do, it also requires you to be skilled enough to breathe soul into it. But do not worry. By patiently following the recommended steps, you can embark on a bright and fun adventure of food photography and become an expert in it as well.
