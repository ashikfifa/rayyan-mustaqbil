Now, the question becomes how you can achieve this success.  In order to stand out from your competitors, you need to take the best quality product photos and in this blog; we’ll be educating you about the guidelines and tips that are sure to increase your conversion.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>How to Reduce Bounce Rate? </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>According to<a href=\"https://feedvisor.com/\" target=\"none\"> a survey by Feedvisor</a>, 89% consumers admitted that they felt more inclined to purchase their necessities from Amazon over all other e-commerce platforms.  \r\n           <br/>\r\nWhen you look around you in the seller central, you’ll see so many sellers marketing and querying about products similar to yours. Observing this and taking long sighs of helplessness is simply not going to help. You need to make sure the world understands and appreciates the beauty of your product. The way to do that is photographing them beautifully.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"20px\",fontWeight:\"900\"}}>Amazon product photo guidelines   </p>\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Get the basics right! </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Amazon has set some basic technical guidelines that you must comply with when uploading your product photos- </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Make sure that file format for all images are in  .tiff, .gif, .jpg or .png </li>\r\n    <li>The images must be at least 1000 pixels; both in height or width </li>\r\n    <li>The preferred color space- sRGB or CMYK </li>\r\n    <li>All image files should be named in the following manner- Product ID-File extension.jpeg/png </li>\r\n    <li>Every product photo must occupy at least 85% of the entire image area.  </li>\r\n    <li>You can upload up to 8 images per product </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>These are the common guidelines that are applicable to all Amazon sellers. Other than that, there are standards that are specific to certain industries. For example- for the sellers in apparel industry, it is must that the cloths they shoot be captured flat or in a model. So check the specific standards before you start shooting.   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Maintain the main photo requirements   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>When your customers casually scroll down product list while visiting, the product photo that should create a “love at first sight” reaction is your main photo. It should capture the entire product in one frame, be shot professionally and portray the actually color of product as well. Amazon requires that you shoot your main photo in a while background without any prop, text or design in order to keep things simple and avoid distraction. The product has to have the main focus and posting of original product photos is mandatory; it can’t be a graphic or drawing.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/recording-human-icon-stereo-wireless.jpg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"chart of cutomer service attributes\"/>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/smartphone-with-earphone-isolated-white-background.jpg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"chart of cutomer service attributes\"/>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Capture Usability and Lifestyle   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>While the main photo brings the entire product in one frame, the additional ones help your customers imagine their life with that product. Therefore, try capturing at least one product photo with a relevant background. For example- if it’s an oven or freeze, set it up in the kitchen (with necessary props) as if it always belonged there. It’s even better if you can add a model aka a smiling face using that freeze or oven. Seeing the product in action and in a relevant environment will aid the imagination of your customer and they’ll be more drawn to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/modern-contemporary-stylish-kitchen-room-interior.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"chart of cutomer service attributes\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Ensure proper product photography planning </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Amazon allows you to upload 8 photos for each product. To utilize this opportunity perfectly, you first need to plan out how the shoot will go. First, list the angles and types of photos you want to upload. Then list them according to length of attraction. After putting the main photo, put the one with the features that you believe will attract your customers more. Your photos should bring your product to life. This is why; make sure you get 360 degree view of each. Also maintain the same serial of angles for similar products so that it’s consistent is soothing to the eye. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Include details through Amazon images</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>According to a research of<a href=\"https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/\" target=\"none\"> Carlon School of Management</a>, the nervous system interprets an image sixty thousand times faster than written description. Shocking, isn’t it? This is why; your product photos should works as substitutes for the descriptions as well. For example- if it’s a piece of clothing, include a size chart and dictate the material as well. If it’s electronics, try to post a video tutorial with instructions about how to post it. You can include an info graphic as well with necessary details of the product.   \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Highlight the packaging of Amazon Products  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Some products come with attractive high-quality packaging that makes it even more attractive. If not, you can customize packaging including the logo of you business as well. This way, you can both increase the visibility of your product and make it more desirable to your customers.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Processing is a must for Amazon Images!  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>As emphasized earlier, surviving as an Amazon seller is not easy. There are thousands of sellers under each category and you must prove yourself to be unique in order to succeed.  Posting raw images on their store is one of main mistakes Amazon sellers make. Regardless of the type of industry you belong to, color correction, background removal, image retouching etc. are important for all. You can either do this yourself or save time by outsourcing.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/best-seller-certificate-stamp-concept.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"chart of cutomer service attributes\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Products photos bring a product to life and fill the void of touching it with own hands. Just like the trees, flowers and beautiful lakes work as the jewels of Amazon rainforest, the product photos are the jewels of an Amazon store. In order to succeed as an Amazon seller, make your product photos your shield and protect yourself against low sales.\r\n</p>\r\n             </div>\r\n\r\n             <div className=\"col-md-4\">\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-4 col-md-4\"> \r\n                <div class=\"row-8\">\r\n            <img src=\"../../assets/images/types-of-photography.jpg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n            \r\n            {/* <div class=\"row-4\"style={{marginTop:\"37%\"}}>\r\n            <img src=\"assets/images/latestblog.jpg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n            </div> */}\r\n            </div>\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"col-8 col-md-8\">\r\n            <div class=\"row-4\">\r\n            <Link to=\"/types-of-photography-which-one-drive-your-inner-passion-most\"style={{textDecoration:\"none\"}}>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontFamily:\"poppins\",color:\"black\"}}>Types Of Photography: Which One Drives Your Inner Passion Most?</p>\r\n                </Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n            <div class=\"row-8\">\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:\"14px\",fontWeight:\"100\",opacity:\"0.6\"}}>Photographs are our way of capturing the world as we see it.
