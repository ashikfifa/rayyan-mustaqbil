Then keep the background and theme of your product constant instead of changing it to a different background for each item.  \r\n            </p>\r\n            </li>\r\n\r\n\r\n            <li><p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Compulsive Cropping (Avoid various image margin for same set of products) </p> \r\n            <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>\r\n            Showing multiple images varying in size and direction, for example horizontal or vertical and large or small, can be very confusing.
