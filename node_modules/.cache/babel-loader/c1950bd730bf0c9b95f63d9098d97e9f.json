Although you’re thrilled to be a part of this exotic adventure, the unpredictable weather, fearful wildlife and the pathway filled with obstacles and thrones naturally scare you. Similarly, for an Amazon seller, the unpredictable weather mirror the constantly changing consumer demand; fearful wildlife seem similar to the surviving in the competitive market of 9.7 million Amazon sellers and obstacle full pathway represent the struggles and challenges sellers face.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/explorer-traveler-observing-trees-amazon.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"chart of cutomer service attributes\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n         \r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}> Being an Amazon seller, you‘re are able to become your own boss and earn financial freedom through dropshipping, retailing and selling your own designed products. Now, the question becomes how you can achieve this success.  In order to stand out from your competitors, you need to take the best quality product photos and in this blog; we’ll be educating you about the guidelines and tips that are sure to increase your conversion.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>DID YOU KNOW? </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>According to a survey by Feedvisor, 89% consumers admitted that they felt more inclined to purchase their necessities from Amazon over all other e-commerce platforms.  \r\n           <br/>\r\nWhen you look around you in the seller central, you’ll see so many sellers marketing and querying about products similar to yours. Observing this and taking long sighs of helplessness is simply not going to help. You need to make sure the world understands and appreciates the beauty of your product. The way to do that is photographing them beautifully.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"20px\",fontWeight:\"900\"}}>Amazon product photo guidelines   </p>\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Get the basics right! </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Amazon has set some basic technical guidelines that you must comply with when uploading your product photos- </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Make sure that file format for all images are in  .tiff, .gif, .jpg or .png </li>\r\n    <li>The images must be at least 1000 pixels; both in height or width </li>\r\n    <li>The preferred color space- sRGB or CMYK </li>\r\n    <li>All image files should be named in the following manner- Product ID-File extension.jpeg/png </li>\r\n    <li>Every product photo must occupy at least 85% of the entire image area.  </li>\r\n    <li>You can upload up to 8 images per product </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>These are the common guidelines that are applicable to all Amazon sellers. Other than that, there are standards that are specific to certain industries. For example- for the sellers in apparel industry, it is must that the cloths they shoot be captured flat or in a model. So check the specific standards before you start shooting.   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Maintain the main photo requirements   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>When your customers casually scroll down product list while visiting, the product photo that should create a “love at first sight” reaction is your main photo. It should capture the entire product in one frame, be shot professionally and portray the actually color of product as well. Amazon requires that you shoot your main photo in a while background without any prop, text or design in order to keep things simple and avoid distraction. The product has to have the main focus and posting of original product photos is mandatory; it can’t be a graphic or drawing.  \r\n</p>\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/recording-human-icon-stereo-wireless.jpeg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"chart of cutomer service attributes\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Auto-adjust the lighting of an image    </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Typically, for say food photography needs handful of sliders to process a photo. You need to use many layers to highlight, or drop shadow, or make contrasts. While with AI, in any case, photographers require just one automated layer. The program chooses how to change things like saturation, contrast, and radiance. Once more, it does this naturally.  \r\n\r\n  <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nWhile AI might do a great job processing the basics, the technology is very limiting, especially from a creative point of view. This implies you might not get the result, and it ultimately might require manual tweaking. Quality control is also important when you’re going to let an AI powered photo editing service provider do the editing work for you. Moreover, AI doesn’t totally eradicate the need to do edits by hand. You still have to review each image before giving it off to the computers or image editing companies. But, in most situations it makes sense to take advantage of AI to speed up your editing workflow.  \r\n\r\nWhen you have lots of editing to do and have deadlines, AI can help speed things up and can save you a good deal of time. Allocate the basics tasks, like basic resizing or background removal, to the computers so you can focus on the more important and creative details of the image editing process. Not everyone has the time and resources to dive into AI head-on, digging and discovering what and how AI can improve your images but, future of image and video editing is certainly AI. It is indisputable how AI software offers plenty of benefits with the image editing process. So, what do you think about Artificial Intelligence being used in the field of image editing?  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n             </div>\r\n\r\n             <div className=\"col-md-4\">\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-4 col-md-4\"> \r\n                <div class=\"row-8\">\r\n            <img src=\"../../assets/images/types-of-photography.jpg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n            \r\n            {/* <div class=\"row-4\"style={{marginTop:\"37%\"}}>\r\n            <img src=\"assets/images/latestblog.jpg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n            </div> */}\r\n            </div>\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"col-8 col-md-8\">\r\n            <div class=\"row-4\">\r\n            <Link to=\"/types-of-photography-which-one-drive-your-inner-passion-most\"style={{textDecoration:\"none\"}}>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontFamily:\"poppins\",color:\"black\"}}>Types Of Photography: Which One Drives Your Inner Passion Most?</p>\r\n                </Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n            <div class=\"row-8\">\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:\"14px\",fontWeight:\"100\",opacity:\"0.6\"}}>Photographs are our way of capturing the world as we see it.
