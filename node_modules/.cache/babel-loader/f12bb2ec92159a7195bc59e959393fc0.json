So your first job is to figure out your target market in order to be able to create personalized contents and campaigns for them. First try to figure out the common characteristics of your target group and create a buyer persona based on that. Conducting periodic surveys, studying the industry and observing the branding campaigns of your peer businesses may help you understand you target audience and their problems, needs and desires. While conducting these researches, your core focus should be to find out the platforms they visit regularly (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter etc.), the search terms they’re more likely to use and the reason to desire your product.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n               <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Mission and vision: Communicate your inner feelings  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Before making or implementing any plan, it’s important to have clarity about both yourself and your customers. While figuring out the target audience provides you clarity about your potentials customers, your mission and vision helps create clarity about your business and yourself. Think about why you started the business in the first place. The motives that made your think about the need of the product and the feelings you want to convey to your customers through the products constitute your vision. Missions, on the other hand, are more specific. The represent your long term goals and describe the benefits and values the product will be adding to your customers lives. Visions create an emotional connection and missions provides a more strategies angle of the business and defines your brand. Plan them properly and keep them concise and easy to understand. All this is to create a connection with your audience, so there should be an alignment between your business goals and what the customers believes in. Also, it’s important not to exaggerate or lie about your business ideals, as customers will be able to see through if your actions don’t match your words.  </p>\r\n\r\n           <img src=\"../../assets/images/business-strategy-success-target-goals.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"chart of cutomer service attributes\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Content Marketing Strategy </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Anything and everything your write on your website is a part of your content marketing strategy. In a physical store, you have the luxury to use spoken words to attract your customers. In online, the persuasion is done more through the written contents on your website and this is why, it’s important that you stand out. Start with the basics. The banner text, the page and service descriptions should be to the point and they should be reviewed and updated on a regular basis. Surely pictures speak a thousand words but that never vaporizes the importance of written words. So make sure you write realistic product descriptions including all perks and quarks of the product as customers today admire realism rather than having false hope. It’s also a good idea to have a blog page where you would publish writings related to your line of work and industry as blog pages work great as traffic drivers and generate organic leads.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/MicrosoftTeams-image (58).jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"chart of cutomer service attributes\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Visualize your Business!  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>If you enter a physical store and see it’s full of clutter and dust, what would you think? Seeing how disorganized the store is, you interest in its product may automatically go away. It’s the same with online stores but instead of clutter and dust, it’s blur, low resolution or unprocessed photos that make that store looks of poor quality. Rule of thumb: never use unprocessed or low resolutions photos in your website.\r\n<br/>\r\nFocus on creating a logo that represents your business and your ideals as logo is basically the face of your brand. Design multiple banners for your home page each with a Call to Action button leading viewers to different pages of your website. Needless to say, it’s always best to use real product photos and make sure you edit them properly as well.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/20545.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"chart of cutomer service attributes\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Don’t Stop the Contents! </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Photos and write-ups are basic necessities to keep your website breathing and alive. While it’s important that you start your journey with them and always keep them on a check, it’s important to keep expanding you content collection with different varieties. Start with basic videos that explains your business to your customers. Then move to product demonstrations videos so people are more aware about its use in their lives. Other than that, periodically release infographics that informs your customers about ongoing trends, styles and other important current topics. It’s also a good idea to hold regular podcasts as people will prefer listening than reading the contents you write. You can discuss the trends in your business, the blogs you publish, go for collaborations or bring in guests to keep retaining your customer’s attention.   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 <img src=\"../../assets/images/MicrosoftTeams-image 3.png\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"customer service executives working office\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Simply making these contents is not enough. You need to market them properly as well. Regularly post about them on your social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc.) as maintaining your visibility is a big part of branding. Keeping this in mind, only market your brand in those platforms where your customers are present. Always keep the “out of sight, out of mind” concept in head.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Dive in with E-mail Marketing </p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>You’re doing great things in your business. You’re regularly uploading blogs, holding podcasts and introducing new collections that you know your customers are going to love. But are you customers being updated about these regular changes? You customers are already as busy as they can be and it’s silly to assume that they’ll be regularly visiting you website to know about the new updates you introduce. It’s your duty to let them know and the way to do that is through email marketing. It’s best if you create a marketing calendar and plan your email marketing’s beforehand in accordance with the upcoming events, clearance or discount offers.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/empty-modern-creative-agency-office-with-dual-monitors-setup-with-processing-video-film-montage-vide.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"empty modern creative agency office with dual monitors setup with processing video film montage video\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Resolution 7: Prepare a routine calendar of agendas </p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Operating an online business is not an easy task. You have to keep thousand things in mind and a huge time of your everyday working hour gets spent on filling daily chores. But getting too caught up on daily chores may hinder you from fulfilling your long term goals like- expanding your product line. This is why, it’s important that you have all your plans organized in one place along with a timeline for implementation.  \r\n                 <br/><br/>\r\nThe last resolution we’re advising you to have this year is one of the most important ones. First, prepare yearly agendas that you wish to fulfill in the upcoming years. The make you quarterly plans in accordance with that. Next, break it down to your monthly and weekly plans so you know what to do and when to do it. The gist of the resolution is to always have a plan and be on routine so you know you’re always getting ahead and walking the footsteps needed to fulfill your long term goals. Always review and revise your plans to implement the necessary changes in them with changing time, plan and strategies.  \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nNew Year means new beginning – at least that’s the way we hope things are for you. The e-commerce world is clearly not a bed of roses. While the business provides you with its daily challenges and struggles, hard work and persistence brings you thrills and rewards that are worth fighting for. The resolutions we have explained in this blog are just to make the road you’re taking less difficult and help make your goals seem more transparent.\r\n</p>\r\n       \r\n             </div>\r\n\r\n             <div className=\"col-md-4\">\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-4 col-md-4\"> \r\n                <div class=\"row-8\">\r\n            <img src=\"../../assets/images/types-of-photography.jpg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n            \r\n            {/* <div class=\"row-4\"style={{marginTop:\"37%\"}}>\r\n            <img src=\"assets/images/latestblog.jpg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n            </div> */}\r\n            </div>\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"col-8 col-md-8\">\r\n            <div class=\"row-4\">\r\n            <Link to=\"/types-of-photography-which-one-drive-your-inner-passion-most\"style={{textDecoration:\"none\"}}>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontFamily:\"poppins\",color:\"black\"}}>Types Of Photography: Which One Drives Your Inner Passion Most?</p>\r\n                </Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n            <div class=\"row-8\">\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:\"14px\",fontWeight:\"100\",opacity:\"0.6\"}}>Photographs are our way of capturing the world as we see it.
