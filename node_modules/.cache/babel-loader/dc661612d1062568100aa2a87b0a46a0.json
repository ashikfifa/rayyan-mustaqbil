We often\r\n                 place our orders based on the appearance of the food on the menu. Whether consciously\r\n                  or unconsciously, we’re estimating the taste of the food based on its looks. Not\r\n                   only that, you’ll often observe highly qualified chefs putting a lot of time and\r\n                    effort into garnishing a dish and making it look clean, elegant, and mouthwatering.\r\n                     All this proves the importance of the visual appeal of a food item. And what screams\r\n                      louder about visual appeals than a well captured photo of food?

Never let food sit for too long before photographing it. No amount of light or editing can provide the vibrancy a freshly cooked meal can. If you’re working with vegetables or fruits, it’s best to buy them the day before the shoot. If that’s not possible and you have to buy them beforehand, cover them with a wet napkin before storing it in the fridge. That way, the water will protect the food from getting dinted.\r\n           <br/><br/>\r\nWhile photographing delicious looking food is one of the most fun things you’ll ever do, it also requires you to be skilled enough to breathe soul into it.
