After that you have to understand the various aspects of the photograph itself.  \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThere’s various genre of photography that includes wedding, event, product, abstract, nature, fine art, architectural, wildlife, photojournalism, scientific, aerial, etc. </p>\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Let’s know more about depth of creating a style for your brand.   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>\r\nIf your company is for wedding photography you will most likely focus on the following elements which are; Portraits, natural lighting, candid photographs that express emotions or have wildlife in the background.  \r\n<br/>\r\nOn the other hand, we have product photography companies that focusses on lighting terminology, artificial background, all in all making a certain product stand out.  \r\n<br/>\r\nImplementing a photo style guide effectively can be tricky. Choosing your photography style doesn’t just stop at choosing a genre it also includes the composition of your photos such as: \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Subjects </p>\r\n    <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>\r\n    A single photograph can show several things, the point where you’ve focused in the photograph and also, it’s entire figurative point of views.  \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFor example:  \r\n<br/>\r\nIt is the emotions of the subjects or the position of the object that you represent, while keeping in mind what the background is representing in that situation as well.  \r\n<br/>\r\nThe image on the left is just a lamp, while on the right we have an image that is visualising a lamp along with other furniture as well. The image on the right simply represents what your brand has to offer in one single photo. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/Lamp-focus-diffence.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"Lamp-focus-diffence\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}> Colour palette </p>\r\n\r\n       <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>   One particular colour palette is usually followed by brand that the normally matches the established brand-guide or theme. Identify what your brand is about so you can align with relevant colors, example: your company emphasises on the fun or entertaining aspects, you’ll most likely be using bright colours for your palette. On the other hand, or your brand is targeted towards formal and conventional part of audience. In that case you’ll be choosing subtle or pastel colours for your palette. \r\n   </p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    \r\n\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}> Positioning & framing  </p>\r\n\r\n       <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>  This might seem like a small function but it represents elements of a scene to create a frame that is within your frame.
