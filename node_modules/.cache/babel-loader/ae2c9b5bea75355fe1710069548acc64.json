It will become\r\n              a partner in your journeys and carry memories that you’ll never\r\n              forget.

Photographing something so exquisite and\r\n              valuable will obviously require your full attention, skill set and\r\n              expertise. It’s an art form and you must master it.

The few minutes\r\n              before sunrise and few minutes after sunset mark the beginning and\r\n              end of a day. Such brief moments are considered golden hour due to\r\n              the warm comfortable vibe they provide.

This is why, we recommend you choose outdoor\r\n              shooting over indoor in case of photographing cars. While choosing\r\n              your location, make sure you avoid any prop or place that might\r\n              distract the eye of the viewer. A car is a flashy object. Shooting\r\n              it in a place surrounded by tall flashy buildings, other cars or\r\n              equipment is probably not a good idea. Rather photograph the car\r\n              in location customers can actually see themselves in. A friendly\r\n              neighborhood, broad highway or close to the mountains will help\r\n              customers visualize their future adventures with the car.{\" \"}\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <img\r\n              src=\"../../assets/images/pexels-brett-sayles-1592261-600x400.jpg\"\r\n              class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"\r\n              width=\"80%\"\r\n              height=\"20%\"\r\n              alt=\"Beautiful red jeep on the mountains with a wonderful weather and one door open\"\r\n            />\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p style={{ fontSize: \"18px\", fontWeight: \"700\" }}>\r\n              3.

So whatever background you choose will\r\n              obviously reflect on its surface. This is why, ensuring a simple\r\n              background with an adequate space all around the car is important.\r\n              Now, you have to make sure you don’t reflect on the car as well!\r\n              The best way to do that is use a tripod, place it with a timer and\r\n              then vanish before it goes off.{\" \"}\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p style={{ fontSize: \"18px\", fontWeight: \"700\" }}>\r\n              4.

But sometimes\r\n              even in the simplest backgrounds, it’s difficult to ensure this. A\r\n              method called bokeh, where you defocus your background helps you\r\n              highlight the car perfectly and avoid all distractions. What you\r\n              have to do is place the aperture at f/2.8 and increase the shutter\r\n              speed of your camera. This will blur out the background and focus\r\n              just on the car. These types of shots are normally taken close-up\r\n              to highlight specific features of the car or to provide the front\r\n              view.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p style={{ fontSize: \"18px\", fontWeight: \"700\" }}>\r\n              5.

Capturing all features in one or two shots is almost\r\n              impossible. You need to plan out the angles you’ll be shooting\r\n              from. Make sure you get the entire background and the car in one\r\n              frame so that it’s more relatable to the viewers. Although a\r\n              little complex to click, moving car shots are considered very\r\n              attractive. A car driving in a highway with mountains and trees in\r\n              background will aid the imagination of viewers as well. Also\r\n              rather than all shots in eye level, take some from top or bottom\r\n              angle to get an artistic feel.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p style={{ fontSize: \"18px\", fontWeight: \"700\" }}>\r\n              6.

When you’re photographing a car, don’t just capture\r\n              the steel and headlights.
