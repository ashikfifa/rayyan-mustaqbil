And more importantly, how do we reduce them?</p>\r\n           \r\n\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>What is Bounce Rate?</p>\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>According to Google, “A bounce is a single-page session on your site.” In other words, a bounce is when a visitor exits your page without engaging with any element. Such as clicking on any image or link or browsing further. A high bounce rate means that users are not engaging with your website. This can happen either because your website is not relevant to what the users are searching for, or because it is not engaging enough to keep user attention for long.</p>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-md-1\">\r\n                \r\n                </div>\r\n            <div class=\"col-md-7\">\r\n            <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\",fontSize:\"14px\"}}>To calculate we can take help from Google Analytics. You can see The Bounce Rate Equation as per the Google analytics from the given image. In simpler terms, Google divides your bounced (single-page) visits by the total number of visits (sessions) to your website (or page).</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n            <img src=\"../../assets/images/Bounce-rate-equation.jpeg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n         <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Impact of Bounce Rate</p>\r\n\r\n         <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>At this point, you must be wondering why your bounce rate is a big issue. Whether, at all, you need to keep tabs on your bounce rate. Well, you do, because Google does. And when Google sees that your webpage has a high bounce rate, it decides that your website has poor or irrelevant content, and therefore lowers your SEO ranking. Here’s why maintaining a low bounce rate is important: </p>\r\n                 \r\n\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Low Conversion Rate</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>You can drive lots of traffic to your site. But it is not good enough if they are not engaging with your site. All the money you spent on bringing people to your website is lost cause. Because, they don’t interact with your website and have no scope of being converted from a one-time visitor to a loyal customer.  </p>\r\n\r\n               <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Google Ranking Factor</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>A high bounce rate can hurt your SEO. Bounce rate is strongly correlated with your SEO Ranking. If your website has a higher bounce rate than it will rank lower in Google’s search results and vice versa.</p>\r\n\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Indicating Quality of Traffic</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Chances are that the people who are visiting your site are not the ones you want to attract. Maybe your advertisement got placed incorrectly, or is being shown to the wrong target audience. Keeping tabs on your bounce rate helps to ensure that you are knocking on the right doors with your ad campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n                 <img src=\"../../assets/images/Bounce-rate-Chart.-519x649.jpeg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Before you decide how to fix your bounce rate, you have to know whether your bounce rates are high or not. Because, of the varying nature of how different users search based on what they are looking for. Bounce rates are different for different industry verticals. A high bounce rate in one industry may be very well within the limit for another. The chart below will help you understand whether you need to be at all worried about your bounce rates or not.\r\n                 <br/><br/>\r\nIf you are facing issues with high bounce rates, the first question you need to ask yourself is: “why are users leaving without engaging with my site?”. To answer this, you have to view your site from the perspective of a user and reflect upon these points:\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Are the right people coming to your site?</li>\r\n<li>Is the site pleasing to the eye and easily understood?</li>\r\n<li>Are there engaging elements (such as links to other pages and images)</li>\r\n<li>What reasons do they have to stay back on your site and read more?</li>\r\n<li>How can you increase the points where they can engage?</li>\r\n<li>Does your site offer the complete checklist of what they are searching for, so \r\n    that they don’t need to go elsewhere?</li></ul>\r\nThese questions will help you get an idea of how to lower your bounce rate, but to understand the complete picture, you must know the exact reasons why people exit a site without interacting with it, or maybe without even fully viewing it. Place yourself in the shoes of the user and imagine, if you faced the problems below, would you stay on that site for long?<br/>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Reasons of Bounce Rate</p>\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>If you have a higher-than-average bounce rates, consider if it is because of the reasons listed below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Slow Load Time:</p>\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>If your site takes too long to respond, users would not want to wait for the site to load. Why? it’s simply because they do not have time to wait for your website. A slow website cannot hold the interest of a visitor for long. But, a website with quick response will add bonus points for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Poor Navigation:</p>\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>The fewer clicks it takes the user to get what they want, the happier they will be. A visitor will be frustrated leave the website after a few clicks and scrolls. This happens because the visitor doesn’t get what he is looking for. This means that you have to preempt what users are looking for and organize your website accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Page Didn’t Meet Expectations:</p>\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>If you are looking an image editor for your product photos, you search for “image editing apps” on Google. You click on the first link that appears and look to upload your image. But, if you cannot find where to upload your images, or how to download the image. There is a high chance that you would not keep searching. You would rather would go back to Google to search for a better site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Ugly or Poor Design:</p>\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>To keep a visitor on your website, the layout and design of the website has a huge impact. Even if you have world-class content, which is sure to convert your visitors into customers, but the layout is poorly designed, chances are that the user won’t even get to reading the content – they will simply be put off by the unattractive design and leave your site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Bad UX or Poor Usability:</p>\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Even if your site is designed well and looks trendy, users may still decide to leave your site. Why? Because, they may be having trouble navigating your site. Maybe your font size is too small to read, or maybe there are so many design elements on your page that it looks crowded and unattractive. So, If your website is laborious for the visitor to navigate then users will not spend as much time on it as you had hoped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Lacks Clear Call-to-Action: </p>\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Lastly, even if your website ticks all the above boxes, bounce rates may still be high. Why? A high bounce rate shows that visitors aren’t interacting with your site. Maybe the problem is that there aren’t many clear call-to-action buttons, where they can interact. If your site does not call upon the visitor to do something, such as view a product demo, subscribe to an email newsletter, request a consultation, estimate or quote, take advantage of special offer etc. No matter how great your site is, visitors will find no place to interact, this causes the visitors will simply read and leave your website, leading to a high bounce rate.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nWondering what steps to take to minimize your bounce rate?
