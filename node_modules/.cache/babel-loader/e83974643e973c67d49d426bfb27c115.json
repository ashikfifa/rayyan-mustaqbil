It feels as though editors are the fairy godmothers of e-commerce and when they point their wands at a product photo and say -“bibidi babidi boo”- even a scraped good will turn into something gorgeous. But is the idea really accurate? \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nWe often perceive editing as a way to distort viewers from the reality and present them with something fake instead.

In the other half, you polish and modify the photo through photo editing to help it become its beautiful self.  \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nProduct photos are the heart of an e-commerce website. Ensuring perfection in product photos is a necessity we all must abide by. But even if we try our hardest, we may not be able to ensure perfection in every photograph. Some flaws are bound to persist.  Perhaps the lights won’t seem accurate in some photos; there may be crease or wrinkle in the product, the background may not be appropriate etc.  This is when photo editing comes in bearing a torch to guide you to get high quality product photos.

Maybe the color will become too bright or the photo will be manipulated to the extent of changing it overall. So ultimately, when customers receive the product, they’ll be disappointed as it’s different from what they saw in the picture. As a result, product returns will increase. While editing is capable of doing all that, the main purpose of editing is not to distort the originality of your photo but to enhance it. Editing will provide you room to make mistakes while photographing it. Photo editing will help you get rid of that wrinkle you didn't notice, or the lights you couldn't brighten, and retouch any other flaws that could make your clients leave your page without hitting on the buy button. </p>\r\n\r\n           <img src=\"../../assets/images/professional-editor-doing-retouching-work-image.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"French fries salad and other food items with forks and and sauce on a yellow background\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Fact 2: Outsourcing Photo editing don’t have to be expensive </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{/* DESCRIPTION */}\r\n\r\n\r\n   <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>The main intent behind outsourcing is to save time and effort that can be better utilized elsewhere. Whenever we outsource, we try to hire an expert who has better knowledge of the subject matter and can do a faster, better and more effective job. The same goes for photo editing. If you do your research well enough, you’ll be able to find out image editing services that will provide you with best quality images at a reasonable price. It’s better to outsource and get expert quality services rather than doing inadequate editing job that may not even achieve your desired results  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n            {/* SUB-HEADING */}\r\n\r\n     <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Fact 3: Photo editing can’t rid you of all the imperfections </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{/* DESCRIPTION */}\r\n\r\n\r\n   <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>As we emphasized earlier, photo editing can only help enhance the originality of your photo and not make it into something different. So it’s our duty that the photographs are taken professionally and we try to maintain as much precision as possible. For example- if it’s a cloth, wash and iron it properly. Editing won’t help if the entire cloth is full of wrinkles and dust. FOr examplle, you cannot expect to take a photo in a dark room and hope for the editing to bring it to its original color. At the same time, you can’t take a blurry photo and expect editing to clear it out. These are not reasonable expectations at all. If areas to fix aren’t clearly visible, there isn’t much the editor can do anyways.   </p>\r\n\r\n   <img src=\"../../assets/images/tattoed-photographer-his-creative-studio-choosing-photos-hipster-man-work-editing-shooted-images-job-trends-fashion-technology-concept-focus-hands.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"French fries salad and other food items with forks and and sauce on a yellow background\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Fact 4: Outsourcing photo editing won’t demean your control   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{/* DESCRIPTION */}\r\n\r\n\r\n   <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>We go for outsourcing to ensure expert help. It’s your business and knowing every part of it is your way of ensuring that everything’s going well. When you’re outsourcing the image editing for your product photos, you’ll still be the one providing instructions, giving feedbacks until you get the desired output. If you still feel insecure, prepare a contract that ensures proper communication between you and the image editing service so your standards and style are upheld and nothing goes south.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n   <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Fact 5: The photo format does matter!  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{/* DESCRIPTION */}\r\n\r\n\r\n   <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>The format we take photographs in matter to a great extent. Cameras have functionalities of their own to edit and enhance a photograph. The images we get in JPEG format contains such functionalities and are already edited to some extent by the camera. We appreciate these inherent editing features when we’re taking personal photographs that won’t go for editing. But when we’re taking product photos for our business that will be edited later, it’s better to go with the RAW format. The RAW format contains more data and is not pre-edited in any way. So we’ll be working with a fresh bunch that can be edited as per our requirement.  \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nPhotographing a product provides you only with half of the picture that can’t be completed without proper photo editing. Beautiful RAW photographs will take you to the interval stage but the climax, happy ending and the bow you take in front of your audience comes after you let your photos grow to become artistic through photo editing. You can go for in-house photo editing to ensure you requirements and control remains intact. On the other hand, photo editing services can help you get the expert view you need to draw in more customers and generate higher sales. Either way, editing is clearly a must and can’t be taken for granted.   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}><b>Caption:</b> Most of us perceive photo editing as a way to distort viewers from the reality and present them with something fake instead.

While image processing, you should aim for a standardised approach covering the first basics - <b>image margin</b>, sharpening, saturation and finally how you save for web size and quality.
