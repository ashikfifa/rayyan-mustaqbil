More computer software companies are presently switching over to machine learning. However, post-production of images is an exceptional story. It is usually a repetitive job, specially clipping of images, altering the background and basic retouching of mannequin or products. This makes the editing process much faster and help users focus on the creative output instead of the monotonous manual task's commonplace in editing apps. Creativity can change the complete outcome of an image.

While figuring out the target audience provides you clarity about your potentials customers, your mission and vision helps create clarity about your business and yourself. Think about why you started the business in the first place. The motives that made your think about the need of the product and the feelings you want to convey to your customers through the products constitute your vision. Missions, on the other hand, are more specific. The represent your long term goals and describe the benefits and values the product will be adding to your customers lives. Visions create an emotional connection and missions provides a more strategies angle of the business and defines your brand. Plan them properly and keep them concise and easy to understand. All this is to create a connection with your audience, so there should be an alignment between your business goals and what the customers believes in. Also, it’s important not to exaggerate or lie about your business ideals, as customers will be able to see through if your actions don’t match your words.  </p>\r\n\r\n           <img src=\"../../assets/images/business-strategy-success-target-goals.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"chart of cutomer service attributes\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Content Marketing Strategy </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Anything and everything your write on your website is a part of your content marketing strategy. In a physical store, you have the luxury to use spoken words to attract your customers. In online, the persuasion is done more through the written contents on your website and this is why, it’s important that you stand out. Start with the basics. The banner text, the page and service descriptions should be to the point and they should be reviewed and updated on a regular basis. Surely pictures speak a thousand words but that never vaporizes the importance of written words. So make sure you write realistic product descriptions including all perks and quarks of the product as customers today admire realism rather than having false hope. It’s also a good idea to have a blog page where you would publish writings related to your line of work and industry as blog pages work great as traffic drivers and generate organic leads.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/MicrosoftTeams-image (58).png\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"chart of cutomer service attributes\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Visualize your Business!  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>If you enter a physical store and see it’s full of clutter and dust, what would you think? Seeing how disorganized the store is, you interest in its product may automatically go away. It’s the same with online stores but instead of clutter and dust, it’s blur, low resolution or unprocessed photos that make that store looks of poor quality. Rule of thumb: never use unprocessed or low resolutions photos in your website.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFocus on creating a logo that represents your business and your ideals as logo is basically the face of your brand. Design multiple banners for your home page each with a Call to Action button leading viewers to different pages of your website. Needless to say, it’s always best to use real product photos and make sure you edit them properly as well.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Don’t Stop the Contents! </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Photos and write-ups are basic necessities to keep your website breathing and alive. While it’s important that you start your journey with them and always keep them on a check, it’s important to keep expanding you content collection with different varieties. Start with basic videos that explains your business to your customers. Then move to product demonstrations videos so people are more aware about its use in their lives. Other than that, periodically release infographics that informs your customers about ongoing trends, styles and other important current topics. It’s also a good idea to hold regular podcasts as people will prefer listening than reading the contents you write. You can discuss the trends in your business, the blogs you publish, go for collaborations or bring in guests to keep retaining your customer’s attention.   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 <img src=\"../../assets/images/MicrosoftTeams-image 3.png\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"customer service executives working office\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Simply making these contents is not enough. You need to market them properly as well. Regularly post about them on your social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc.) as maintaining your visibility is a big part of branding. Keeping this in mind, only market your brand in those platforms where your customers are present. Always keep the “out of sight, out of mind” concept in head.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Dive in with E-mail Marketing </p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>You’re doing great things in your business. You’re regularly uploading blogs, holding podcasts and introducing new collections that you know your customers are going to love. But are you customers being updated about these regular changes? You customers are already as busy as they can be and it’s silly to assume that they’ll be regularly visiting you website to know about the new updates you introduce. It’s your duty to let them know and the way to do that is through email marketing. It’s best if you create a marketing calendar and plan your email marketing’s beforehand in accordance with the upcoming events, clearance or discount offers.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Serve your customers well  </p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>The tips and hacks we’ve discussed till now are for attracting customers to your website. But the way to making them into permanent ones is a whole another job. In a fast and fierce e-commerce world as today, there’s always competitors with substitute products who are fighting to take away your customers. This is why, you must serve your customers well.  Always be active and try to respond to their queries within 24 hours. Provide an active email address and keep a Chabot too for people who prefer chatting over a long and formal email. Be it review or any other social media mention, always reply when you’re tagged in social media. Hold contests and lotteries often as these are the things that gets people excited and brings you closer to them. Being kind and polite can never serve you wrong.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/MicrosoftTeams-image 2.png\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"customer service executives working office\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>\r\nThe journey from being an online business to being a brand that’s knowable and likable by everyone is not easy.
