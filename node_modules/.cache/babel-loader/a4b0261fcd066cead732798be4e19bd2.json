They just dispatch the products and start clicking pictures with their Smartphone. We have come up with 6 steps will ensure that your pictures guarantee higher sales volume.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Arrange a Suitable Device for Product Photography </p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Confused about what a \"suitable device\" exactly means? Rather than focusing on the brand, you should ensure it has the required features. Ensure a device with minimum 12 megapixel camera and 100-millimeter screw-on lens. The first choice for any professional photography is a camera. But if your Smartphone fits this description, it will serve your purpose.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/view-professional-modern-camera-screen-tripod.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Create a Relevant Background </p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>This is where you need to take a deep look with your creative eye. Don’t worry; it’s easier than you think. You can either choose a plain white background that would put focus on your product or you can get an earthy real life background that will help consumers better imagine its use in their lives. Try to think from your consumer’s perspective and imagine how you would want this product to be presented. That’s it! Whatever you imagine is your answer.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Light All the Way! </p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>One of the problems faced by e-commerce business owners is that the photos they take don’t reflect the true color and features of their product. Adequate lighting helps solve that problem. You can go for either natural or studio lighting. You can go for natural lighting when shooting outdoor or with a person. For indoor shooting, it’s better to get some studio lighting such as – LED ring light or panel photo lights. Keep in mind, sometimes too much or too flashy lighting distorts the color of the product. This is why, the right amount of lighting is very necessary \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Set Everything Up  </p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>But just like everything else, in order to have a creative and sophisticated result, you need to ensure everything is organized. First, you need to ensure you have an empty space where you can conduct the shoot. Then set up the product table with the background you have created in your head. You can use props if you want but make sure your product gets the spotlight.  Also, make sure to use Tripod to have consistency from shoot to shoot. The tripod will also systematize you photos and help get clear shots.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Diversity in Product Photographs </p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>You can’t fill the void of physically holding a product through a single product photograph. In a physical store, consumers get a 360 degree view of the product. You need to ensure that in your online store as well. Therefore, get as many angles as possible so that all the features of your product are visible and buyer are able to make an informed decision. Make sure you get zoomed in shots as well to get a feeling of the texture and intricacy in design of product.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/1936.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Ensure Proper Product Photo Editing </p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>If you have completed all five steps described till now, you already have a decent looking picture of your product. But they are still raw images that need to be processed to increase their visibility and attractiveness. There might be wrinkles in your product photo and faults in the background which will hinder its appeal. Product photo editing measures will help you remove these faults and shift the core focus on your product. You can try editing the images yourself but the best practice would be to take professional help from image editing company like – CutOutWiz to get an expert support.  \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAround 25% of returns happen because the products match their picture. This is mostly because consumers place their orders based on a vague idea and unclear pictures. In order to survive in this competitive e-commerce business world, you need to ensure best quality product photographs and following the six steps described above will help you do that. There’s clearly no alternative for creative product photography to reach that sales volume you’re targeting.  </p>\r\n\r\n             \r\n             </div>\r\n\r\n             <div className=\"col-md-4\">\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-4 col-md-4\"> \r\n                <div class=\"row-8\">\r\n            <img src=\"../../assets/images/types-of-photography.jpg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n            \r\n            {/* <div class=\"row-4\"style={{marginTop:\"37%\"}}>\r\n            <img src=\"assets/images/latestblog.jpg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n            </div> */}\r\n            </div>\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"col-8 col-md-8\">\r\n            <div class=\"row-4\">\r\n            <Link to=\"/types-of-photography-which-one-drive-your-inner-passion-most\"style={{textDecoration:\"none\"}}>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontFamily:\"poppins\",color:\"black\"}}>Types Of Photography: Which One Drives Your Inner Passion Most?</p>\r\n                </Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n            <div class=\"row-8\">\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:\"14px\",fontWeight:\"100\",opacity:\"0.6\"}}>Photographs are our way of capturing the world as we see it.
