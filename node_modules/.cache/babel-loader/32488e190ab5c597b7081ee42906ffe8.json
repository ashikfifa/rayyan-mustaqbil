Never let food sit for too long before photographing it. No amount of light or editing can provide the vibrancy a freshly cooked meal can. If you’re working with vegetables or fruits, it’s best to buy them the day before the shoot. If that’s not possible and you have to buy them beforehand, cover them with a wet napkin before storing it in the fridge.
