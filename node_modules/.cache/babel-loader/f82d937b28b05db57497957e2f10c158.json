You’ve been working at the same speed and following the same pattern for a while now. It’s time you get a new perspective, introduce some changes and work to give your business a better and distinguished identity. That’s what new year resolutions should be all about, right? \r\n                 <br/>\r\nWe always expect a new year to bring new hopes, new dreams and beautiful realities to fill our world with happiness, excitement and achievements. But only hoping for things never works. This New Year, we need to step up our game and take on journeys full of focus and hard work so we can reach our destinations.  </p>\r\n         \r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/beautiful-fireworks-display-black-sky.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"beautiful fireworks display black sky\"/>        \r\n           <br/>\r\n\r\n<i style={{fontSize:\"20px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}> “Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right.” </i>        <br/> <br/>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"right\",fontFamily:\"poppins\",fontSize:\"18px\"}}>Oprah Winfrey <br/>\r\nAmerican Philanthropist and<br/>\r\nTalk-show Host</p>\r\n\r\n      <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Most people start their new year with an overly optimistic enthusiasm and set goals that are ambiguous and impossible to achieve. This results in a sorrowful death of that enthusiasm just in a few days and before you know it, the year ends leaving you just where you were at the beginning. Keeping that in mind, you need to set challenging goals that are attainable by stretching out efforts and stepping outside of your comfort zone. This is why, you need to be careful and follow the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) guideline while setting your goals.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"20px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Top New Year’s Resolutions for E-commerce Businesses </p>\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Resolution 1: A promise to clean up the clutter </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>The step one to starting your e-commerce business is designing your website. You designed pages in accordance with the experiences you had at that time and in line with the then ongoing trends. But as time went by, new and better features became available. Chances are that even though you incorporated the new features, due to the extreme busy schedule of operating a business, you forgot to remove the old or obsolete pages. Such dead pages reduce the quality of your website and distract viewers when they come to visit.  \r\n           <br/><br/>\r\nThis year, your first resolution should be to review the entire website, detect the dead pages and delete them altogether. While you’re at it, check if all pages are up to date or not. If not, get on working to create a more relevant, precise and efficient website. Also make a promise to match your product list with your inventory from time to time. Often, products gets stocked out and yet we forget to delete or update them on our website. This creates unnecessary confusion and give you consumers’ false hope too! \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n               <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Resolution 2: Step up your game with analytics </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>All businesses make decisions and form strategies based on popularity of products with consumers. In offline shopping, such popularity is determined through manual observation of purchases being made. This process, as you can already assume, is both time consuming and tedious. As an online seller, you have an advantage here.  Google analytics helps you track the number of visitors on each page, amount of sales made every day and provides you with an effective decision making system.  \r\n           <br/><br/>\r\nThis brings us to our second resolution. Make a promise to yourself to audit the performance of your website every month using google analytics. Such regular audits with intel such as amount of traffic, popular search terms, click to conversation rate etc. will automatically inform you of the steps to be taken for the betterment of your business.  </p>\r\n\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Resolution 3: Build a viewer friendly website </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>According to a study by Big Commerce, around 54% of all e-commerce sales came from using a mobile device. In addition, around 40% potential consumers are more likely to switch to a competitor after an unpleasant visit. This is why, it’s important to ensure that your website is provides equal comfort and ease in each and every device, let it be a desktop, smartphones or tablet. It’s important that you design the pages separately for website and mobile views as screen size differences can result in distorting the design of the website. Also by tracking your viewers’ movements using video recordings and heat maps, you’ll be able to understand where consumers are facing hindrance and make small improvements  to improve their experiences</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Resolution 4: Become a consumer centric business </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>A business has different types of customers with different personalities and interests. It’s safe to assume that not all of your customers will be interested in all products in your website. They would prefer to see only their desired categories and may even leave if it takes them too much time or hassle to find their desired ones. Web personalization helps you customize your viewers’ experience by making their desired categories and products appear in front of them. In order to implement web personalization, you’ll have to collect visitor data, categorize them based on their distinguished characteristics to optimize their experience on your store.  </p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/20545.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"chart of cutomer service attributes\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Resolution 5: Communication is key </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>This year, make a new year’s resolution to improve your communication mediums to become more consumer friendly. There’s plenty you can do to implement this. For example- it’s a good practice to have a Chat bot to resolve daily consumer query’s as that’s a much quicker and more convenient two way communication medium. In such a diverse and lucrative e-commerce market like today, it doesn’t take long before consumers lose interest in a product. Keeping that in mind, make a promise to be more active on your website and always reply to emails and chats within 24 hours. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nWe often introduce new products but forget to introduce them to our customers. Later, disappointment arises when sales are low despite having a trendy, up and coming collection in hand. Utilize email marketing and regularly send your previous buyers updates on new products, offers and discounts so you’re always on their mind and so they turn into your regular customers. Email marketing is a good way to stay “on top of the mind” of the consumer. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 <img src=\"../../assets/images/customer-service-executives-working-office.png\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"customer service executives working office\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Resolution 6: Post high quality edited product photos </p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Images make or break your website. A photo speaks thousands time louder and clearer than any content you have on the website. Especially for an e-commerce seller like yourself, photos are the way you express your product to your customers. All this points make a strong case for having high quality product photos in your e-store. Keep a thumb rule in mind: never post un-edited pictures in your website. No matter how high quality camera you use, even a small crease or scar on the product can distract the consumer into not buying your product. The lighting may not be enough or the true color of the product may not get highlighted through the product. Therefore, always post high quality edited product photos in order to attract consumers and boost sells.  \r\n</p>\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/empty-modern-creative-agency-office-with-dual-monitors-setup-with-processing-video-film-montage-vide.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"empty modern creative agency office with dual monitors setup with processing video film montage video\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Resolution 7: Prepare a routine calendar of agendas </p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Operating an online business is not an easy task. You have to keep thousand things in mind and a huge time of your everyday working hour gets spent on filling daily chores. But getting too caught up on daily chores may hinder you from fulfilling your long term goals like- expanding your product line. This is why, it’s important that you have all your plans organized in one place along with a timeline for implementation.  \r\n                 <br/><br/>\r\nThe last resolution we’re advising you to have this year is one of the most important ones. First, prepare yearly agendas that you wish to fulfill in the upcoming years. The make you quarterly plans in accordance with that. Next, break it down to your monthly and weekly plans so you know what to do and when to do it. The gist of the resolution is to always have a plan and be on routine so you know you’re always getting ahead and walking the footsteps needed to fulfill your long term goals.
