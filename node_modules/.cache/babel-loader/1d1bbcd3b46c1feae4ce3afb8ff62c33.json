The same applies for \r\n           product photography. Being new to this e-commerce business, it’s more likely that you’re not an expert \r\n           in product photography. This is why you need to focus on educating yourself first. List down the big\r\n            companies in your industry and visit their website. Now try to comprehend the techniques they are\r\n             applying in photographing their product; the number and types of photos they are posting, the angles\r\n              being used etc. For example- you may notice websites posting a main photo consisting of only the\r\n               product and other shots where details of the product are properly highlighted. You can see videos\r\n                on YouTube as well and read different blogs as well to get an initial understanding of product\r\n                 photography as well.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Work with a Home Studio or Natural Setup for small business product photography</p>\r\n        \r\n\r\n            <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>For a small business, affording a full formal\r\n             photo studio along with the expensive tools in it may seem scary. And keeping the amount\r\n              of sales you’re likely to make or the range of collections a small business may own, \r\n              it doesn’t seem worth it as well. You do not need a fully designed photo studio to photograph\r\n               your products. Rather, you can easily setup a home studio and photograph your products there.\r\n                Pick a comfortable corner of your house with good lighting and decorate it with a table, \r\n                tripod, camera and a white cloth for the background. That’s it, you’re good to go!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                <div class=\"row\">\r\n                <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                    <img src=\"assets/images/portrait-young-woman-taking-smartphone-photo-raw-ceramic-bowl-pottery-workshop-post-social-media-small-business-concept-copy-space-1024x683.jpg\"width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                    <img src=\"assets/images/photography-blogging-workshop-concept.jpg\"width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div><br/>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Other than that, you can focus on lifestyle photography where \r\nyou take photos with a relevant background and natural lighting.  Also, pairing up your products \r\nand shooting them together can aid your business by reducing the need for props and result in duel \r\nsales.  Try to pick a relevant setup, for example- photographing wines near a vineyard or grape garden,\r\n cars on the road, men and women’s formal wear near a tall corporate building etc. This is likely to help\r\n  the viewer better imagine the product’s use in their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n   <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Rely on easier to find tools</p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Photo shoot require tools and equipment that you can’t escape from. \r\nRather than focusing on getting professional and expensive tools, it’s better to initially start with\r\n highly available and DIY solutions. There are certain tools you can make at home. Instead of a backdrop,\r\n  you can simply use a white wall or paper or simply the floor of your studio (for flat lay photography).\r\n   You can easily make a DIY softbox that will deflect light perfectly and redirect it equally in all corners\r\n    of the room. Also, if you’re looking for props to use for in the photo shoots, try to think with your\r\n     creative eye and focus on getting tools that are easily available to you. For example- if you’ve a \r\n     face wash with vitamin C in it, pairing it up with sliced up oranges/lemon and plants you have at home \r\n     may do the trick.</p>\r\n        \r\n\r\n     <div class=\"row\">\r\n                <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                    <img src=\"assets/images/bottle-cosmetic-skincare-serum-with-dropper-orange-palm-leaf-beauty-spa-concept-3.jpg\"width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                    <img src=\"assets/images/grapefruit-oil-serum-bottle-put-green-light-background-2.jpg\"width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <img src=\"assets/images/6159822-768x432.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"\"/>        \r\n           <br/>\r\n\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Focus more on Social Media Marketing</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>As we discussed earlier, during winter, people get more time to \r\n           be on their phones as the cold forces them to stay at home. As a result, an increase in online\r\n            shopping has been observed as well. This is the reason you should focus more on social media \r\n            marketing. Start by making a calendar and properly planning your posts. It’s important to maintain \r\n            consistency and relevancy in the content you post. This is why your content should be in line with\r\n             the product and industry you operate in. Use social media to highlight the products on your website.\r\n              Also, update viewers of the offers, deals, and discounts you’re offering on your website.\r\n               Run polls asking them what kinds of collections they want to see next and take their opinions\r\n                on different matters. Make sure you post high quality product images of the products you’re \r\n                selling right now or hope to sell in the future. High quality images will help your customers\r\n                 know how attractive your product really is, whereas poor quality images will drag down the\r\n                  reputation of your business.</p>\r\n\r\n               <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Make shopping an experience, not a chore</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Winter is the time to shower your close ones with gifts and\r\n            surprises.

The gifts don’t have to be expensive as well; rather \r\n             it’s the surprise element that will get you on their good books. Also, arrange giveaways by \r\n             inviting them to help expand this family of yours. As they refer your website to their dear \r\n             ones or invite them to your social Medias, it will help your help you enter new horizons.</p>\r\n\r\n                 <img src=\"assets/images/woman-shopping-online-christmas-sales-768x512.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Let’s make winter easier!</p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>While winter showers a lot of people with feelings\r\n                  of joy, many suffer from misery due to their poor financial conditions. By engaging\r\n                   in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), you can use your business to make winter \r\n                   easier. For example, you can launch campaigns where a specific percentage of every \r\n                   sale goes to help people in need. Setting reasonable prices can help people greatly \r\n                   too, as it enables them to buy more products. Doing these things will likely generate\r\n                    a positive image for your business and may even end up boosting your sales. But be\r\n                     careful as you arrange such campaigns. Whatever you do should be from the heart,\r\n                      and the intent to do something good has to be present as well.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nWinter is the season of joy- for both consumers and sellers. It’s full of festivals,\r\n excitement and happiness. It’s the time for your e-commerce store to shine and rise \r\n up conversion rate.
