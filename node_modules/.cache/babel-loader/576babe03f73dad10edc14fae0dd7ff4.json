It’s the season that brings \r\n         back old memories and creates now ones at the same time. It’s the season of singing carols, \r\n         spending hours playing with snowballs and building Snowmen. It’s the season when the entire\r\n          family seats around the fireplace, opens presents under the Christmas tree on the Christmas \r\n          morning and sings Christmas carols together. These are the emotions you have to channel to your \r\n          customers. In your winter collections, try to add lifestyle photos that portray such nostalgic moments \r\n          with your products in us. It is also a good idea to use common catchphrases like “Ho ho ho” or famous\r\n           quotes like- “Winter is Coming” from the show Game of Thrones to bring a smile on your\r\n            consumers face.</p>\r\n        \r\n\r\n            <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Focus on Customer Interaction</p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>The best marketing is one that connects and communicates with customers.\r\n Winter is the season when people stay at home more to protect themselves against the cold weather. This \r\n enables them to have more free time. Utilize this by holding surveys and quizzes where you try to learn\r\n what your customers are looking for and how they perceive your brand. Your clients are surely the best \r\n judges of your business. These tactics will help you gain insights about consumer preferences and habits\r\n  and get feedback as well. Keeping the holidays in mind, you can hold different contests as well. For \r\n  instance- announcing a photography contest (with a desired reward, obviously) where people post their\r\n   “best winter memory”. This way, you’ll be able to bring out nostalgic memories and have your page filled \r\n   with heartwarming photographs as well. These tactics will help increase the visibility of your store and \r\n   likely increase your traffic as well.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n   <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Arrange for Sales and Offers</p>\r\n\r\n<p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>As the weather changes abruptly, people require a change in most of \r\nthe items they own – be it the dresses they wear or the home decor to keep the house warm. But income \r\ndoesn’t increase proportionately with spending needs, does it? Be the understanding, consumer-friendly \r\nseller you are and focus on setting reasonable prices that benefit both you and the consumer. Here, \r\nfocusing on making a profit from bulk quantities rather than from setting high prices is a more appropriate\r\n strategy. Also, offer discounts and hold sales on your website and market them on all your advertising\r\n  channels as this is the time people are likely looking for sales to fit all their demanded products within\r\n   their budget.</p>\r\n\r\n        <img src=\"assets/images/6159822-768x432.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"\"/>        \r\n           <br/>\r\n\r\n           <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Focus more on Social Media Marketing</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>As we discussed earlier, during winter, people get more time to \r\n           be on their phones as the cold forces them to stay at home. As a result, an increase in online\r\n            shopping has been observed as well. This is the reason you should focus more on social media \r\n            marketing. Start by making a calendar and properly planning your posts. It’s important to maintain \r\n            consistency and relevancy in the content you post. This is why your content should be in line with\r\n             the product and industry you operate in. Use social media to highlight the products on your website.\r\n              Also, update viewers of the offers, deals, and discounts you’re offering on your website.\r\n               Run polls asking them what kinds of collections they want to see next and take their opinions\r\n                on different matters. Make sure you post high quality product images of the products you’re \r\n                selling right now or hope to sell in the future. High quality images will help your customers\r\n                 know how attractive your product really is, whereas poor quality images will drag down the\r\n                  reputation of your business.</p>\r\n\r\n               <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Make shopping an experience, not a chore</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n           <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>Winter is the time to shower your close ones with gifts and\r\n            surprises. Make your customers feel like a part of your family by providing them with small\r\n             gifts that catches them by surprise. The gifts don’t have to be expensive as well; rather \r\n             it’s the surprise element that will get you on their good books. Also, arrange giveaways by \r\n             inviting them to help expand this family of yours. As they refer your website to their dear \r\n             ones or invite them to your social Medias, it will help your help you enter new horizons.</p>\r\n\r\n                 <img src=\"assets/images/woman-shopping-online-christmas-sales-768x512.jpg\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"  width=\"80%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n                 <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontWeight:\"700\"}}>Let’s make winter easier!</p>\r\n\r\n                 <p style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>While winter showers a lot of people with feelings\r\n                  of joy, many suffer from misery due to their poor financial conditions. By engaging\r\n                   in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), you can use your business to make winter \r\n                   easier. For example, you can launch campaigns where a specific percentage of every \r\n                   sale goes to help people in need. Setting reasonable prices can help people greatly \r\n                   too, as it enables them to buy more products. Doing these things will likely generate\r\n                    a positive image for your business and may even end up boosting your sales. But be\r\n                     careful as you arrange such campaigns. Whatever you do should be from the heart,\r\n                      and the intent to do something good has to be present as well.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nWinter is the season of joy- for both consumers and sellers. It’s full of festivals,\r\n excitement and happiness. It’s the time for your e-commerce store to shine and rise \r\n up conversion rate. All this is achievable by simply following the right marketing strategies \r\n and giving your full focus and effort. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             \r\n             </div>\r\n\r\n             <div className=\"col-md-4\">\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-4 col-md-4\"> \r\n                <div class=\"row-8\">\r\n            <img src=\"assets/images/types-of-photography.jpg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n            \r\n            {/* <div class=\"row-4\"style={{marginTop:\"37%\"}}>\r\n            <img src=\"assets/images/latestblog.jpg\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n            </div> */}\r\n            </div>\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"col-8 col-md-8\">\r\n            <div class=\"row-4\">\r\n            <Link to=\"/types-of-photography-which-one-drive-your-inner-passion-most\"style={{textDecoration:\"none\"}}>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:\"18px\",fontFamily:\"poppins\",color:\"black\"}}>Types Of Photography: Which One Drives Your Inner Passion Most?</p>\r\n                </Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n            <div class=\"row-8\">\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:\"14px\",fontWeight:\"100\",opacity:\"0.6\"}}>Photographs are our way of capturing the world as we see it.
